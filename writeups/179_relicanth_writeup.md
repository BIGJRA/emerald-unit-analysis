### Analysis

**TL;DR: Relicanth isn't very unique and is available late, but gets it done.**

I personally think Relicanth is a pretty cool Pokemon, but there ultimately isn't a ton that I can say about it as a unit, good or bad. After designing Hoenn's oceanic routes and HM Dive, they needed to design a few Pokemon that would live underwater: aside from one obvious choice in the angler fish Pokemon Chinchou, they created Clamperl and Relicanth to fill these spots. Relicanth is an underwater ancient Pokemon that fits in quite well with the environmental storytelling that Generation III is going for. Unfortunately, there are a million Water and Rock types out there that are obtainable far earlier: the player also MUST have at least one Water type Pokemon in their party in order to dive underwater in the first place. One would hope Relicanth has some standout traits among Water types: while its Swift Swim ability is super common, its dual typing and stat line of a Rock type helps here to some extent. Yet there are other literally three other Rock type lines with Rock Head available far earlier than Relicanth - two of them can use Surf as well! Towing the line between these two archetypes unfortunately doesn't really help it stand out in any meaningful way for a player looking to add one to their team.

All that said, Relicanth is still worth grabbing. For one, it is needed to get the legendary Golem trio, giving it lore if nothing else. If using it long term, a player can instantly get Relicanth going with the Rain Dance TM or Double-Edge via move tutor in Emerald to support either of its abilities, at least. On top of STAB Rock Tomb and later Ancient Power by leveling up, Relicanth functions best as a bulky attacker/status spreader thanks to its 100 / 130 / 65 Defensive stat spread and 90 Attack. Its low SpA means that it can't make much out of the usual Water/Ice move combination compared to other Water types, but it does get curiously get the TM for Calm Mind to patch up two of its worst stats regardless. It may be able to run Rest, learned by level-up, and Calm Mind to slowly sweep some of the hardest fights in the game - Wallace and maybe Steven included. It's pretty funny how even a seemingly random set up move like Calm Mind still gives Relicanth something to do and a way to be actively valuable. Relicanth gets it done even if it suffers a bit from being just another ~~fish~~ coelacanth in the sea.
