### Analysis

**Verdict: One of Pokemon's essential nuisances-turned-growth-unit isn't unique to Hoenn, but pays off adequately.**

We all know the memes: walking through caves in the Pokemon world mean endless Zubat encounters. Zubat, Crobat, and Golbat take up 3 of the 67 exclusive slots in the Hoenn dex granted to Gen I and II Pokemon, which begs the question: why Zubat? Considering there isn't really anything else introduced in Hoenn that could really fill this role though, it makes sense that the Zubat line is included here. Zubat is able to fulfill its strong narrative role for the player that it got thanks to its final evolution introduced in Gen II with some new bells and whistles in Hoenn, so doesn't feel too stale in its third conspicuous appearance in a row. Let's get into how this unit feels and the story it tells.

The best time to get Zubat is its first appearance, in Granite Cave. Ruby and Sapphire held all non-Gen III Pokemon until after Roxanne, and Zubat is among the first available after this point (Emerald would give us Abra earlier, for some reason). As an enemy, Zubat is pretty annoying: with its reasonable 55 Speed, healing from Leech Life, flinch option in Astonish, and confusion chance from Supersonic. With how frequent this Pokemon is, most players will encounter many and at least a few will be encouraged to catch one to try out this "annoying" moveset. Immediately the player will see the problem: while this moveset will be aggravating to fight over and over again, it doesn't make for a strong individual Pokemon against other cave denizens or trainers during this segment due to the inconsistency and low damage of the set. Whether this was an intentional design choice or not, the TM for Steel Wing given by Steven at the end of the cave feels uniquely tailored to Zubat in Hoenn: granting it a decent early game damage option but still limited by the bad matchups Steel faces offensively and its 90% accuracy. Bite comes around to be a Special alternative to Astonish once Zubat gets some levels going. Its first gym fight is against Brawly, where it has an obviously fantastic defensive type matchup yet still will probably lose alone to Seismic Toss and Bulk Up thanks in no small part to its lack of way to deal meaningful damage to the Fighting types. Even when it should feel like a great choice, Zubat (and its low 245 BST) is a nuisance to use in this early part of the game.

A rainbow shines above Zubat once it reaches Lv. 21 though: it gets Wing Attack! Its first STAB damaging move and a good offensive type besides, this move helps push it through one more level to becoming Golbat, whose 455 BST is respectable in its own right. Pushing the weak and annoying Zubat through about 12 levels suddenly means the player has a respectable speedy attacker on their hands. But it only gets better from there: the Soothe Bell is available in Slateport City... and unless the player bothers with the nearly obsolete Baby Pokemon, Golbat gets the honor of being the only Pokemon that wants this thing in order to evolve. The earlier that the player chooses to get Zubat, the more time they are willing to spend training this annoying Pokemon up to Golbat and then letting it contribute to their team... the sooner it is able to reach its full power levels as a Crobat! This usually happens after defeating Wattson who still basically walls Golbat and Crobat, but it could be rushed if desired.

Crobat puts out the love it needed to receive in order to evolve in the first place - its 85/80/80 defenses mean it can hold up pretty well throughout most of Hoenn, and its 90 Attack over 130 Speed is just incredible for sweeping potential. One of the few great options at the move relearner this game has is Screech, allowing Crobat to debuff things it has bad matchups against before switching out. Although it basically relies on TMs to get the rest of its movepool, it is able to come together well before too much of the game has passed it by. Return is a strong option building upon the Friendship investment needed to evolve it in the first place, Sludge Bomb is a decent option for the rest of the game, Shadow Ball covers its Psychic weakness so well that it can sometimes OHKO some of the biggest threats to it, and Fly/Aerial Ace take advantage of its other STAB for broader coverage and HM usage / anti-Double team strategies, respectively. It also gets wildcards like Giga Drain for recovery and use of its respectable 70 SpA and Confuse Ray as a straight upgrade to Supersonic and Swagger. Crobat's typing is very neutral in this game: it has decent-at-best matchups against basically all of the bosses in the game after Wattson, but its consistent speed, damage, and potential to debuff makes it a very solid team member throughout the game. A little bit of love given to the most annoying Pokemon in the game pays off in spades, and Crobat is one of the best feeling growth units in Hoenn as a result.
