### Analysis

**Verdict: New life is breathed into the Marill Line in Hoenn, who feels unique and fun. Just don't talk about Azurill.**

The Azumarill line is a quite interesting one - of all evolution lines, it might be the one that has experienced the most identity changes across the series' lifetime. Looking first at its Generation II origins, Marill is an extremely rare Pokemon only available nearly halfway through the game - where it can instantly evolve. Even then, Azumarill didn't really have the moveset to back up its high defenses but pitiable offenses - a very forgettable addition to those games. Gen. III introduces abilities, where Azumarill gets its first major new tool in Huge Power (or Thick Fat, I guess). Gen. IV will introduce the Physical/Special split, allowing it to use physical Water type moves, Gen. V will give it a niche alternate set thanks to hidden ability Sap Sipper, and Gen. VI. will give it the new Fairy-typing. All of these things change Azumarill fundamentally, but in Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald, we don't get these last three major changes just yet. Let's see how Gen. III Azumarill looks in a playthrough.

Emerald gets Marill extremely early - an example of Emerald deviating from the new-Pokemon-only-before-Roxanne rule set by Ruby and Sapphire. Marill has an extremely low stat total in 250 BST, so being able to fight early-game Pokemon and gain EVs allows it a bit of time to shine without being underpowered. Tackle over Tail Whip (for reasons we see later) can deal decent damage in the early game, and Water Gun comes at a perfect time to help out a decent amount against Roxanne! It gets Rollout soon after. Depending on how the player is allocating Exp. in the early game and if they fight some of the trainers on Route 109/110 before Brawly, Marill may even evolve into Azumarill thanks to its very low evolution level, where its high stats compared to the early game will help with the otherwise tough gym fight and Route 110 Rival. After reaching Mauville City Ruby and Sapphire Players can pick up their own slightly underleveled Marill - a bit of switch training will help it evolve and catch back up in no time.

I'll now take the time to discuss the line's abilities. A player picking up a Marill will have to choose its ability. Thick Fat allows the bulky line even more longevity against Fire and Ice type moves, which it already resists. Better than nothing, but not better than its other choice: Huge Power! While this might seem like it turns Marill's 20 and Azumarill's 50 base Atk into 40 and 100 respectively, Huge Power works on the final stat - that means every point gained from a +Atk nature, EVs, and IVs also get doubled by Huge Power. Marill will want every Protein you can get! Now 50 Atk isn't so bad - Azumarill can deal huge damage with physical moves, leaving its Special Attacking capabilities (including its STAB) mostly in the dust, though Water Gun/Bubblebeam can still be useful for taking out Rock/Ground types. The moveset Azumarill can have around this time now looks pretty good: the Defense Curl + Rollout combo gives Azumarill extra bulk and power to bowl over entire teams, often OHKO'ing through resistances on the fourth and fifth hits!

Speaking on its midgame: Azumarill's Electric weakness does make Wattson one of the tougher fights for Azumarill, though with its sheer offensive power and a Cheri Berry it might just sweep some or all of his team regardless. Especially if the player uses the Dig TM on it, Flannery is a joke, and Norman and Winona similarly can be swept by Rollout combos or by spamming something like Secret Power or Return. It gets a few more options after this: Surf is worth having on it aside from the obvious HM utility as STAB Surf hits weaknesses well despite its low SpA. Focus Punch can hit for absolutely absurd damage - Double Team or Substitute in Emerald can help with that. Double-Edge is worth considering too - with more power than Return, Double-Edge hits harder, while Azumarill's high HP stat can help mitigate the downsides of recoil damage.

Now I can discuss... Azurill. We've seen Azurill on the teams of early enemy trainers - easy to knock out, but so is Marill. Around party Lv. 33-37, the player can access Mt. Pyre and the Sea Incense inside. This incense is a terrible held item in this game, but one that unlocks the ability to breed Azumarill for Azurill - a baby Pokemon. Doing this in game would mean obtaining a Lv. 5 Pokemon after having six badges at the earliest... and one that will probably evolve into Marill AFTER Lv. 18 thanks to Friendship taking some time. What do you get out of doing this? Uh... Splash, Charm, Bubble, and Slam. That's it. The only one that is worth even CONSIDERING is Charm, but Azumarill really doesn't need Charm to be successful. Azurill is a cute lil guy, don't get me wrong, but it (and baby Pokemon at large) feel like sheer Pokedex padding... not a well considered gameplay element. You could make the case that the design for Azurill is justification for the Marill line being in Hoenn in the first place, but there are about 60 other Pokemon from Gen. I/II in Hoenn that are not related to any new Gen. III Pokemon.

Rain Dance and Hydro Pump are options if the player really wants to use Azumarill like a "typical" Water type, but Hyper Beam for massive damage, Brick Break and Iron Tail for coverage better round out Azumarill's late game movesets. While even its defensive stats become less impressive into the lategame, Azumarill is still bulky and hard-hitting enough that it can put in work against basically all the late-game fights, too. It can learn Ice Beam or Blizzard in a pinch to deal with Altaria, Salamence, and Flygon on Drake's team, and can learn moves like Toxic and Rest for when its physical attacks may not be enough. Even without reaching the point in the series where it can just run STAB Waterfall, Play Rough, and Aqua Jet, Azumarill is a fun and interesting Pokemon that keeps up throughout the entire game; Hoenn really let this line shine. Or, at least two-thirds of it.
