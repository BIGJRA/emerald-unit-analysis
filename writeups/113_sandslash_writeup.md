### Analysis

**TL;DR: An old straightforward Pokemon breathed new life in the sand: requires luck for its gimmick to shine.**

The Sandshrew line was a member of a version exclusive pair with Ekans back in Kanto, but RSE rips just the Sandshrew line out of this context and includes it in the Hoenn region. Now with abilities on top of weather conditions introduced in Gen II, I will make the case that choosing Sandshrew and Sandslash for two of the Hoenn regions' limited 67 returnee slots makes a lot of sense thanks to the new gameplay experience they provide.

In Ruby and Sapphire, Sandshrew is first found outside the sand, instead on ashy Route 113, but it's replaced with Slugma and instead is only available in the desert in Emerald. Early availability is usually better - it gets to help out against Flannery especially evolved and with the Dig TM in Ruby and Sapphire. But, there is something to be said about how only being able to catch Sandshrew in the desert helps the narrative of using this unit in Hoenn a bit more, which I think explains the move to being desert-only in Emerald. By this point the player has some options with weather-interaction abilities - Seedot and Lotad lines being the obvious ones, though they most likely haven't actually gotten to make use of these abilities at all. Sandshrew might have been a straight forward attacking unit in Kanto and Johto, but here it is explicitly placed in the sand and given Sand Veil. With numerous trainers using this line in the desert, the player may notice the effects of their moves missing. With enough intrigue from this or perhaps a desire for a familiar unit, Sandshrew presents itself as one of a few desert denizen team options. Regardless of when it is obtained though, from here its path is roughly the same going forward through all versions.

Ruby and Sapphire Sandshrew trainers have a bit longer of a growth arc, but either way it evolves very quickly for a Hoenn Pokemon. Catching one in the desert allows it to promote nearly instantly as it catches back up to the rest of its team - delaying evolution isn't valuable here. Sandslash's stats are reasonably good for the midgame: it is physically bulky, can use physically strong attacks... and not much else. The Sandshrew line is notorious for its lack of Ground moves leveling up: only Sand Tomb! Yet the Dig TM is available right around the time Sandshrew is, and the Earthquake TM is late but worth using on Sandslash, so this shouldn't hamper players using one too much.  It doesn't really have the potential to survive many special attacks, and its Speed is a bit too low to be a reliable sweeper. Slash and Rollout/Rock Tomb are good filler coverage moves during this initial training sequence; later on it can use Aerial Ace, Hyper Beam/Return, Brick Break/Focus Punch, and Iron Tail as potential coverage options or opt for something like Toxic. All this amounts to a decent enough Pokemon that doesn't stand out much. But wait, there's more!

The remaining moves can be filled in with what I believe are the ingredients to its standout set, which I will go into here. Other RPGs like Fire Emblem sometimes have the potential to build up a "dodge-tank" unit, inflating an Evasion stat as much as possible to avoid enemy attacks. The uncontested Double Team and Sandstorm TMs are both available when Sandslash is: two of the three tools we need to build the closest thing to a dodge-tank in Pokemon. The first is, well, the former part of its compound name: Sand Veil causes attacks to hit with 80% of their accuracy under a Sandstorm, while six successful uses of Double Team cause attacks to hit with 33% of their accuracy. The third, obtained in Mt. Pyre, is the Lax Incense, which multiplies incoming move accuracy by 95% (BrightPowder is more impactful but is postgame only). Something like Sitrus Berry or Shell Bell may ultimately be more useful, but we'll be maximal with the evasion for now. Multiplying these numbers together on a standard 100% accurate move like Surf results in only 25.08% chance of hitting Sandslash. Of course, that is built upon all six uses of Double Team going off successfully and Sandstorm being up, but that is the ceiling for dodge-tank numbers we're talking about here. Less accurate moves will have even lower accuracy after all is said and done. Sandslash's 75 HP and 110 Defense are just high enough that there will be opportunities for it to live some physical attacks as it gets set up to full. The only other Pokemon with Sand Veil is Cacturne, but Sandslash's higher defenses allow it to be the premier choice for this kind of build.

In a game with many Ground type Pokemon capable of hitting hard with Earthquake, it gets points for at least being something unique. Smogon may have banned evasion strategies, but there's nothing stopping a player from going this route in-game! In theory it is capable of defeating any trainer in the game with some team support and a lot of luck... or not. At the end of the day 25% is far too high of a chance for enemy attacks to be hitting Sandslash, especially when many of the moves it'll face in this game are super effective Special moves like Surf and Giga Drain. These attacks will one shot Sandslash regardless; all that effort to build up evasion and sweep wasted. Without a way to boost Attack itself, it is stuck using its decently strong attacking moves until it picks up KOs or opting for a Sandstorm/Toxic/Sand Tomb stall strategy. Each turn it's left alive (or has to re-up Sandstorm) is another chance for its foes to strike it down, so ultimately its a game of chance every single time the player goes all in on this strategy. But if a player is willing to sit through potentially numerous save resets in exchange for one of the funniest ways to sweep an opponent of choice? Sandslash was given just the tools to do so and framed in a very particular way to draw attention to that fact precisely for those players.
