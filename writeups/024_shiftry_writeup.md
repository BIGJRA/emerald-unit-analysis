# Pokemon Emerald Unit Feel Analysis: Seedot line

Seedot is a Grass type Pokemon, first obtained at Route 102 at Lv. 3-4 in Ruby and Emerald, though it is a 1% encounter in the latter. It and its evolved form can be encountered in some later areas in these two games - notably, one can be traded for in Rustboro City in Emerald with a Ralts. Its ability is Chlorophyll or Early Bird. It evolves at Lv. 14 into Nuzleaf and gains the Dark type, then evolves again with a Leaf Stone into Shiftry.

### Analysis

**TL;DR: The Seedot line has a ton of unique features but is slightly underwhelming when all is said and done.**

With Lotad as a version exclusive counterpart, the Seedot line has synergy with Ruby's legendary Groudon, namely the Sun weather condition. Instead of getting two abilities relating to Sun though, it only has one: Chlorophyll helps it overcome getting outsped in the late game in the cases where 80 Speed is not enough. Its other ability is Early Bird, a strange choice for this line that can be used at best with its decent 90 HP and passable 60/60 defenses to wake up from using Rest after only one turn, niche at best. Arguably, Chlorophyll is preferable in Ruby especially if the player will want to use Groudon in the late game, while Early Bird is the only possible ability on the in-game trade Seedot in Emerald that helps the player avoid searching for the 1% encounter and has increased Exp. gain. This makes it seem like an intentional set up to make this line have a different feel between Ruby and Emerald, which is interesting in its own right.

Seedot starts with pretty low stats and a strange set of moves: just Bide, Harden, and soon Growth. Leveling it with Bide is somewhat tricky. Thankfully, getting past Petalburg Woods allows the player to get the Bullet Seed TM - Seedot (and Lotad in Sapphire) seem uniquely set up without good offensive STAB at the start to make this option appealing and teach the player about TMs. With Bullet Seed, even a Seedot at lower levels can walk right into the Rustboro Gym, knock out the trainers' Geodude, and catch back up in levels easily. With some focus Seedot can even get enough experience to get Nature Power and evolve into Nuzleaf before fighting Roxanne - Nuzleaf's 60 SpA-based Bullet Seed, Harden, and Bide are pretty solid answers for this fight altogether especially for a player who chose Torchic.

Worth an aside is that Seedot has basically an entirely different level up moveset than Nuzleaf, who has an entirely different level up moveset than Shiftry (who has none as a stone-evolution). Choosing to delay the evolution into Nuzleaf means the player has to drag the 220 BST and Dark-type-less Seedot further into the game, but there are some benefits to doing this (if it has Chlorophyll, at least). Not that the player would know this without a guide or by intentionally clicking B over and over, but Seedot gets Synthesis at Lv. 21 and Sunny Day at Lv. 31 allow it to have a pretty solid sun-based set going forward - only Castform can use Sunny Day without the TM besides, so it has this niche going for it if desired. Nuzleaf isn't particularly strong against Brawly, Wattson, Flannery, or Norman anyways, so there isn't a major opportunity cost here; once evolved Nuzleaf can relearn attacks it missed like Fake Out or Torment if desired. Seedot gets Explosion at Lv. 43, which at least is going to do huge damage on top of Shiftry's 100 Atk, though waiting even longer to evolve into Nuzleaf is definitely not worth the hassle (and this move is a tutor in Emerald anyways). 

Whether the player got the sun-based moves or not, Nuzleaf doesn't have a ton of power during the midgame. All weak moves: Fake Out, Rock Tomb, Bullet Seed, Thief, and Strength end up its best offensive options during the midgame - its low defenses prevent easy Growth sweeping, so the player needs to rely on other teammates during this phase. Worth mentioning is its shared signature move Nature Power: while it ends up underpowered and redundant on the Lotad line, it does seem designed somewhat well for this line specifically on paper. The big problem with the line is that its strongest stat is Attack - Shiftry has 100, while its Special Attack is only 90. Both of its STABs scale off of this worse attacking type, meaning any good physical options are appreciated. Nature Power pulls Earthquake in the R109 beach and R111 desert, Rock Slide in rocky terrain like R112 and Mt. Chimney, and Shadow Ball in caves: all great physical moves that it appreciates while it has the chance. It gets Stun Spore in tall grass which is useful for catching, while Razor Leaf is what it gets on R119's tall grass and is its strongest Grass move in those fights. The only other notable interaction is that in buildings it gets the 60 power Normal move Swift... which happens of course to be the terrain upon which the player fights all of the Gym Leaders and Elite Four. So when it counts Nature Power is just Swift, and with Faint Attack later available for the perfect accuracy or Strength/Return to out-damage it... it just makes Nature Power feel pretty bad!

The Leaf Stone is first available on Route 119: Razor Wind, Extrasensory, and Swagger are the only moves that Shiftry would miss out on by delaying evolution... so nothing of value is lost. Shiftry is able to reach its final form here, a whole two badges earlier than Ludicolo. Around here are the numerous TMs it can use to attempt to fix its lacking offenses: Solarbeam is the final piece of its Chlorophyll and Sunny Day synergy, while Giga Drain is another Grass option. Shadow Ball, Aerial Ace, and later Brick Break and Hyper Beam are physical options for coverage it gets decent use out of, but still isn't going to be incredible with them without STAB. 

Against the bosses of Eastern Hoenn - it has a hard time dealing damage to Winona, though it gets its shining moment against Tate & Liza, where BOTH of its STABs do massive damage and it can even use Solrock's Sunny Day to its own advantage. Against Juan it is able to resist Water and hit fairly hard with Grass moves, but its low SpD on top of ubiquitous Ice Beam coverage that he and later Glacia and Wallace have really hamper its survivability. Ultimately Shiftry is unable to hit hard enough with 90 SpA and its STABs to simply sweep fights and its 100 Atk isn't doing it enough favors... while defensively it comes up too short with needing to keep Sun active to keep its speed up. It has a tough time with Glacia and Drake, then at best, it can do good damage against champion Wallace's slower Pokemon like Wailord and Whiscash or Champion Steven's Claydol and Cradily. 

As compared to late-game-legend Ludicolo, Shiftry's incredibly awkward Grass/Dark typing on top of its even more awkward stat spread favoring mixed attacks without the movepool to match makes Shiftry feel a bit underwhelming by endgame. Still, with such a vast array of moves to choose from, two very different abilities, and choices on when to evolve, there are lots of ways to play the Seedot line in Hoenn that make it an interesting unit that can cater to a lot of playstyles.
