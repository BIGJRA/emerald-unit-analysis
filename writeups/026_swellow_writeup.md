### Analysis

**TL;DR: Although it might fall off towards the end, this bird makes a fantastic first impression and teaches the player about team composition well.**

After choosing a starter, the player is encouraged to think about a second party member after the catching tutorial. If the player chooses Mudkip or Treecko, the player will soon notice their starter's respective weaknesses to Grass and Bug. Many trainers have Pokemon of these types in Petalburg Woods, Route 104, and Route 116, so Taillow with Peck at base stands out as a great pick. Torchic players don't have a problem with Bug and Grass types in the first place, so Taillow doesn't stand out as a second party member early on. It is able to gain levels quickly against the Bug Catchers in the woods, but can also teach the player about critical hits through its Focus Energy move, and priority through Quick Attack (if Taillow has been slowed down and doesn't outspeed everything, I suppose). If it gets poisoned by any Wurmple, the player might also see the powerful Guts ability in action. It doesn't take long for Taillow to get the 60 BP Wing Attack, hitting off of Taillow's 55 Atk and STAB to be very solid in the early game against trainers.

One of two downsides to Taillow in the early game comes in the form of the first gym, who uses defensive Rock types that  counter Taillow. Regardless, it can use Growl and chip for some damage in this fight. However, I will make a case that the game is really smart with how it places Taillow in this section, and it isn't a problem from a unit design perspective. Just as Taillow teaches players about its type advantage for Mudkip and Treecko players, the player must learn about the inverse relationship it has with the Rock Type. But, if the player chose one of these two starters and thus was more encouraged to add Taillow to their team in the first place, then Roxanne isn't going to be too difficult. The only difficult combination with Taillow against Roxanne is Torchic, with whom players don't have a strong reason to add Taillow to their teams in the first place!

Moving to Dewford Town, Taillow continues growing its power levels. The Steel Wing TM is not that contested, with one of its best homes being Taillow who otherwise gets no physical coverage. This allows it to at least contribute against the Rock Types the player must still occasionally face instead of basically forcing it to switch out (though the previous paragraph still convinces me it is good that this TM comes _after_ Roxanne). Wing Attack Taillow is one of the obvious best ways to deal with the usually tough gym leader Brawly, with Focus Energy able to break through Bulk Up stacks with some luck if needed. Taillow's base speed also ensure that it has a generally easy time overcoming its lack of bulk insofar as it can one shot many of the enemy Pokemon around this time.

With next-to-no reasons to delay evolution, it evolves into Swellow at Lv. 22, boosting all of its stats: it is the fourth speediest Pokemon in Hoenn! Swellow will never again have any significant type advantages against gym leaders and will even have some difficulties like with Wattson, where its typing and Double Team are countered by Shock Wave. Still, its stats become strong enough here that it can still easily contribute for the time being otherwise. While Swellow's movepool will remain fairly shallow for a while, it does have what it needs to function as well as some fun options. Endeavor is a fun move that works well on top of Swellow's frailty - where if it barely survives the average strong hit, it can bring the opponent low for free. After taking out Flannery, Norman, and Winona, it is a great user of the TMs Return and Facade, the former for consistently strong STAB damage and the latter synergizing incredibly well with Guts. It also gets HM Fly for navigation and also its strongest Flying type move option, or Aerial Ace for anti-evasion strategies.

There's not much else to say about raising Swellow past the sixth badge - not like Agility is providing much utility for the fourth speediest Pokemon in Hoenn or anything. Other than the option of Hyper Beam, basically all of its best moves are already in place by this point and its stats begin to wane slightly as the player approaches the endgame. Defensively, it has a hard time against Tate and Liza as well as Juan / Wallace, but still has the speed to contribute chip damage if nothing else. It doesn't have many standout moments in the Elite Four either, being weak to Glacia and both champions. 

In the generation that introduced abilities though, Swellow does have just the tool needed to pull its weight in the endgame if a player is committed enough. The only playable Normal type Pokemon in Hoenn with Guts, Swellow can abuse Facade for some massive damage. Your mileage may vary with this ability though. Some players believe that the time needed getting a status condition by fighting wild Pokemon with status moves is worth it, while others find this to be a bit more effort than is worth. There are no Flame or Toxic Orbs in this generation, after all. The STAB Facade and Guts combo does go crazy enough that the aforementioned damage problems go away, and it may pick up one-shots on the late Gym Leader and Elite Four Pokemon that otherwise threaten it. It's good that there is an option here for Swellow to contribute late in the game for players that have really bonded with it, and it's a good testament to how Abilities were a fantastic choice for the series starting with this generation.

As a fairly well designed Pokemon that helps you out in the early game, the Taillow line is a good pick for newcomers that can easily add it to their team and get immediate contributions from it. Despite strugging against a lot of the major fights, it is able to keep up overall as speedy Normal and Flying STAB is not a bad thing to have. Guts allows dedicated Swellow fans to keep it viable. Swellow is a very fun unit for playthroughs of Gen. III and its popularity is definitely warranted.
