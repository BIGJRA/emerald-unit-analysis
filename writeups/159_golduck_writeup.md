### Analysis

**Verdict: Golduck stands out only slightly thanks to its abilities.**

One of Hoenn's few "imports" so to speak from the Kanto region, the Psyduck line here plays the part of the Safari Zone exclusive Water type in this game, coming pretty late into the game. Depending on how long the player wants to search, they can catch a Golduck potentially higher leveled than their team should be at this point in the game, which helps it catch up quicker than other late game Water type options. Otherwise, evolving a high leveled Psyduck shouldn't take too long.

Like them, since at point in the game Surf and Ice Beam/Blizzard are available, the rest of its level-up offensive movepool is of little note - Confusion is weaker than STAB Surf even when Super Effective, while Hydro Pump comes late and is a sidegrade at best. Golduck's 82 Atk allows it to use physical moves to some effect - while Screech is functionally out of place for the most part, it can at least learn Return, Aerial Ace, Iron Tail, or Brick Break if desired. The "Psy"duck line has a bit of a "Psychic-type-lite" thing going on, getting some Psychic-inspired moves, yet doesn't possess the type. I found out in writing this analysis that Golduck doesn't even learn Psychic by TM... but it can by Egg Move? Twenty-two years of assuming it did! Anyways, following this theme it has not-widely-available status moves Psych Up and Disable, each with its own significant drawbacks. More interestingly are Calm Mind and Rest, allowing it to use its 80/78/80 defenses and decent 85 Speed to carry late game fights on its own in a pinch, though Pokemon like Starmie will still do it better. It gets all the tools it needs to succeed as a late game Pokemon at least, regardless it is just one duck in a pond of a ton of Water types in Hoenn.

Just about every Gen III Retrospective I've seen on YouTube tends to use a weather team to show off Pokemon Teambuilding synergy at its best. Although not using a Water type in Hoenn is a very strange choice, those playing with Sun teams may find it challenging how to incorporate a Water type into their team... so every one of the YouTubers that has gone with a Sun team I have seen use Golduck as this Water type. Unique to Golduck in this generation, the Cloud Nine ability cancels the effects of weather while the Pokemon is in battle! This means that someone who has set up Sun will get to use Golduck at full power even while the sun is out. Is this a meaningful interaction? Almost definitely not, as weather lasting only four turns after the turn in which it is used is really not a long time at all. Maybe more impactful is the small number of enemy trainers who use weather conditions to their advantage - it nullifies Tate & Liza's Sunny Day, Glacia's Hail, and makes Golduck a bit more survivable in the fight with Wallace (if neutering its own Water moves). None of this is incredible by any means, but if they're gonna through one of Kanto's numerous Water types into the already Water-dense Hoenn, it's good that something helps it stand out regardless.

Or it could have Damp, which is also exclusively on the Psyduck line in Hoenn. Say bye-bye to uh, like ten Baltoy, two Graveler, one Electrode, a Solrock and Lunatone, and notably Glacia's second Glalie using Self-Destruct or Explosion while Golduck is on the field, I guess? It probably outspeeds and oneshots all but two of those anyways. Damp!

Despite being a Water type with poor availability, Golduck feels decent to use and rewards players with two abilities that aren't too impactful but are fun!
