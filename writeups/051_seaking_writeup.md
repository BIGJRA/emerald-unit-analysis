### Analysis

**Verdict: Without any notable traits to make it stand out: why, Seaking?**

A common theme throughout this series of analyses is trying to figure out for what gameplay reasons GameFreak re-introduced Gen I and Gen II Pokemon in Hoenn. Sometimes granted new abilities, new moves, or just to fill a hole that the new Pokemon don't, there are many reasons why this may happen. Yet of all the Pokemon covered in this series so far, I truly fail to see what GameFreak was thinking by bringing this line into Hoenn as is. It's available sooner than it was in Gen I, though about on par with when it is available in Gen II, so it doesn't get a boost from earlier availability like Marill or Skarmory. Goldeen is one of the earlier Water type choices available - it competes with Mudkip, Wingull, Lotad, Marill, Tentacool, and Magikarp. Yet each of these mons has some kind of interesting growth arc culminating in a unique playstyle amongst the others by the end of the game: as we will see, Goldeen doesn't have this. It isn't even an interesting utility Pokemon: it gets only the three Water type HMs, but so do the other fish. It is remarkably unmemorable and its moveset and statline don't do it any better.

450 BST on paper is fine, but Seaking has a weird distribution thereof. 92 Attack and 65 SpA implies that it should be using physical moves, yet without STAB this number is fairly puny. Its speed is middle-of-the-road - combined with Swift Swim, it can at least run a semi-competent set under Rain, which makes it "just another fish in the sea" thanks to the ability being on tons of Hoenn Pokemon. Alternatively, its Water Veil ability is almost entirely useless since burns are not common... but at least as a physical attacker this ability "makes sense". It has just enough bulk to be able to survive attacks now and then, but without any flair in its moveset, it doesn't get to shine.

Speaking of this moveset, what do we have? Peck and Horn Attack show off the general theme of this line: HORN. Horn Attack works fine for damage, while Supersonic (and its potential tutor upgrade Swagger) give the line something else to do when physical damage isn't enough early on...? Moving forward Flail is there to allow it to do high damage... without Focus Sash or Endure. Down the pipe we have Water and Ice coverage... the generic Normal moves like Secret Power, Hyper Beam, and Double-Edge... ooh, I know! Horn Drill! Fits the theme perfectly and is available right before the... Elite Four. Who overlevel the average players team and thus is useless there. Oh. And that's really it offensively: you have a choice between STAB Water under Rain for passable damage, weak Ice moves, and non-STAB Normal moves working off of Attack. Peck and Hidden Power are literally its only options for physical coverage! Surely then it has some utility? A few weather moves, common status moves like Double Team and Toxic... Yeah nope nothing noteworthy. I'm being a tiny bit disingenuous: it is the only Pokemon in the game with Swift Swim, a decent Attack stat, and Flail. This means that the combination of Rain Dance, Substitute, Flail, and a filler move like Surf works best on Seaking out of any Pokemon in this game. Still though, this is an Emerald-only set that requires a lot of fine-tuning and some luck with enemy AI. Mid!

But what if I told you there was another way? What simple changes could GameFreak have made to Seaking to make it interesting and fun to play? Well one obvious one is making Waterfall physical, though for this series I'm operating on the assumption that the physical-special split isn't needed to still create interesting units. What instead would be cool are two things: MegaHORN, and LightningROD. GameFreak will eventually actually figure both of these out to some degree, but not without the effects of power creep on all the other Pokemon... leaving Seaking forever uninteresting. Anyways, Megahorn is FRLG only and extremely late, while LightningRod will eventually be a hidden-only ability for Seaking. Both of these exist in these games though, though LightningRod doesn't yet have its effect of converting electricity to SpA. Assuming that tweak is in place, what remains? Seaking has a hard counter to Electric and a soft counter based on its strongest stat to Grass - both weaknesses covered!

There's also one more simple way to make Seaking stand out just a little bit in this game. What's more basic, more simple, more _Normal_ than a Goldfish? If they're gonna make a physical attacking Pokemon drawing on only Normal moves, the least they could do is throw some STAB and a Ghost immunity onto it! Bibarel will eventually be the sole Normal/Water type Pokemon, but here was the perfect opportunity to make the series first Water/Normal Pokemon.

Seaking doesn't have anything interesting going for it yet the potential was there in multiple ways, and ends up simply being a baffling disappointment that doesn't even quite have meme-factor going for it like Luvdisc!
