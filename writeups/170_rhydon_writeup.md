### Analysis

**Verdict: A massive movepool doesn't save Rhydon trainers for getting little but Frustration out of using it in Hoenn.**

The Rock, Electric, Fire, and Normal gyms have already been beaten by the time you get Rhyhorn, and using it in the Flying gym would require skipping it until Lilycove City. As in Kanto, Rhyhorn shares the same typing with the Geodude line and is obtained later... but in Hoenn, almost nothing remains after obtaining one but Water types everywhere. Both of its typings are shared with tons of better lines obtainable way earlier in the game, as well. As with any Gen I/II Pokemon, it is worth asking _why_ Rhyhorn and Rhydon were chosen for 2 of only 67 slots for returning Pokemon in the Hoenn Pokedex... and it's hard to see the answer to this question. The only answer I really have is that Rhyhorn is there just because the Safari Zone is there, and Rhyhorn's inclusion is a callback to the Gen I safari zone? It's stats - massive HP, Atk, and Def, specifically - and movepool do allow it to be a functional member of a team (and indeed is a reasonably good pick in FRLG this generation) but in Hoenn it just doesn't add up to good unit feel. Let's explore a bit of why.

One major problem with the Rhyhorn line is the level-up movepool combined with the late evolution level. Rhyhorn is consistently behind the curve on basically everything: it's only STAB option via level-up / move reminder away is Rock Blast. The Rollout tutor and Rock Tomb & Dig TMs are also significantly behind in power by now and most likely have been used by now, but are Rhyhorn's best options for STAB damage. Thus Rhyhorn's entire viable moveset comes from TMs, so at least evolving as soon as possible is the way to go. Speaking of TMs, there are a TON that Rhyhorn can make use of. You can supplement its Physical damage with Strength... Frustration or Return... Secret Power... nothing that really help it stand out. But then on the special side, this thing is absolutely jacked? It gets Surf, Ice Beam/Blizzard, Shock Wave/Thunderbolt/Thunder, and Flamethrower/Fire Blast. Rhyhorn has the Normal-type archetypical TM movepool... but only 30 -> 45 SpA to back it up with!!! None of these moves would even become special in the next generation either, so its clear the design intent here was sacrificing moveset efficiency for special breadth.

Rhyhorn hits the ground running with all these options available from the Lilycove Department Store, Thunder probably being the standout as there are tons of Water types coming up. But even then, Rhyhorn has only 25 -> 40 Speed and probably gets one shotted by most of the aquatic trainers. Getting Rhyhorn up 13 levels in order to evolve is absolutely painful unless the player saved it a ton of trainers in the non-aquatic portions of the map or is willing to staple the Exp. Share to it. Horn Drill at Lv. 38 is early for an OHKO move, but isn't that impactful and will fall off against the Elite Four unless the player is willing to grind Rhydon up immensely. Even if it is evolved, Rhydon has no particular strengths against Tate & Liza, isn't particularly good against Team Aqua trainers, and contributes little against Juan/Wallace.

Earthquake by level up is too late. Megahorn, which would be a fantastic way to help Rhydon stand out as a Rock/Ground type, is too late. Lightningrod is a pretty useless ability considering its Ground typing and lack of threatening Doubles Electric type enemies... but Rock Head synergizes well with Double-Edge, a tutor move in Sootopolis City in Emerald that ends up being stronger than STAB Rock Blast most of the time. If the player is willing to rush to get this move, TM Brick Break, and TM Earthquake right after getting Dive, they can make a competent physical movepool, with Iron Tail a potential option later on. For how slow it is and how weak it is to special moves, Lax Incense, Shell Bell, hell, even Quick Claw are probably necessary to get as much mileage out of Rhydon and its moveset as possible.

Against the Elite Four, Rhydon doesn't have a single fight where it doesn't face at least one super effective attack from something faster than it. Still, Rhydon contributes fine against some of Sidney's team (would be better with Megahorn), fine against Phoebe, poorly against Glacia, and poorly against most of Drake's team (maybe if you switch it in to avoid Intimidate it can use Rock Tomb or Blizzard or something to help with Salamence, but I won't hold my breath). Wallace obviously drowns Rhydon, but even Steven in Ruby and Sapphire has a move on every single Pokemon that hits Rhydon super effectively. Yikes!

Rhydon never catches a break in this game. Basically all important fights that remain after you get it leave no room for contributions. Counting Rock Slide and Crunch through breeding, Rhydon literally gets attacking moves of at least 75 BP in ELEVEN of the seventeen types... but the distribution of them throughout the game combined with its pitiful SpA stat makes this novelty wear thin quickly. Although its not great either, Aggron already fills the role of a Pokemon that evolves at Lv. 42, is weak to common late game types, learns a _ton_ of coverage moves, has Rock Head as its best ability... but Aggron at least is a new Hoenn Pokemon, has a longer and more fulfilling growth arc, has more SpA to use its movepool, and is a unique typing here. A filler Pokemon to the core, Rhydon isn't even on any major enemy teams... it is as much an uninteresting filler Pokemon as could possibly be in the Hoenn Pokedex!
