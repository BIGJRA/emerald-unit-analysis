### Analysis

**TL;DR: Nosepass is just Onix 2. A two-badge stretch of bare usability doesn't save it from being more of a frustration than an asset by far.**

[People more knowledgeable about game design than I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3mVb4sTE7U) have already covered what makes Onix so unique in Generation I Pokemon: it serves as a tool to teach the player about type advantages in the first gym depending on what starter they have picked, yet when available as a unit for the player later on is pretty pathetic. At least Onix could exploit its high speed and the absolutely broken Bind in Generation I, here we're stuck with the incredibly unremarkable Nosepass. As a Pokemon in Roxanne's team, Nosepass stands out for its monotype preventing it from getting instantly flattened by Water and Grass moves, its high defense prevents it from being knocked out too easily, and its Rock Tomb is strong enough for the first boss. Defeating it is not a completely insignificant feat unless the player has grinded levels for their starter and evolved it, so Nosepass is able to be somewhat memorable as an enemy. 

But this isn't any other RPG: by the series' core design: every single enemy Pokemon is catchable by the player too, a condition broken only by Eternamax Eternatus in Sword and Shield a few years ago. The player, with only the Pokedex to go on, might try to obtain one in Granite Cave when they arrive, but GameFreak pretty much went as far out of their way as possible to bury Nosepass here. Not only does the player need to backtrack once they have HM Rock Smash, they also aren't guaranteed to get one when they do. It feels somewhat like having to actually make Nosepass obtainable is a bit of a burden, and as we'll see, they did the bare minimum to make using it feel rewarding. In this analysis I will make the case that, before assuming that Probopass would later exist, GameFreak could have done a ton more to make Nosepass better that, crucially, don't alter the experience of fighting it.

Its stat line makes sense given its design and as a first boss, but it doesn't make it immediately feel great. 30 HP is really pathetic, basically balancing its 135 Defense and making its 90 Special Defense feel insignificant. Still, this is just enough that Nosepass will have the juice to start gaining levels against random trainers post Mauville City. With 45 in each Attack stat plus 30 Speed... well, its pretty clear that Nosepass won't be an offensive powerhouse and will eventually need to fill the role of supporting tank somehow. The best things that can be said of Nosepass generally happen during this very first phase of having one: it is actually a competent option to make use of the TM for Shock Wave that you'll have by now, as it is able to target enemy SpD, counters Water types, and fixes the accuracy problems that its Rock type moveset will otherwise have. Thunder Wave at Lv. 22 is actually a good support move thanks to its accuracy, and the strongest Rock move in this generation, Rock Slide, being available at Lv. 28 is just in time for the gym fight with Flannery and is nice to have. Especially boosted by the sun, Overheat will hurt Nosepass, but it just might be able to overcome her slow team with Rock Slide and paralysis to be a contributing team member. It also has the potential to survive attacks, paralyze, and use naturally-learned Sandstorm against Norman to some degree of success, so that's neat I guess.

Dropping Nosepass before crossing the water on Route 118 is the best thing a player can do for it, just after... not wasting any effort into it at all. 30 HP and 90 SpD will not be enough going forward: any Pokemon with competent special attacks will crumple it easily. Nosepass simply doesn't get enough tools to be useful going forward: Rock Slide is the strongest STAB it will have. It gets upgrades to Shock Wave in Thunderbolt and Thunder TMs if desired, but by this point the Water types can fight back more effectively. I will give Nosepass some credit for what its late moveset is clearly attempting to do: low accuracy moves plus Lock-On. The 50/50 accuracy Zap Cannon basically combines Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave, guaranteeing paralysis; on top of similar tutor move DynamicPunch that confuses, this moveset in a vacuum seems like it makes sense. Will Nosepass in the late game live enough turns to use Lock-On _every other turn_ simply in order to deal like 10% of enemy HP and apply status conditions? Probably not. Aforementioned Sandstorm (which doesn't even boost SpD in this generation, ugh!) and Rest are learned by level up as well, but its defensive stats don't cut using these moves effectively.

I don't need to spend too long belabouring this point: this set eats it against pretty much all the boss fights left. Even Winona has Water, Grass, Steel, and Ground moves to knock Nosepass down. No more moments for it to pop off remain, and it is basically a full liability against Glacia, Drake, and either champion and living long enough to use Thunder Wave or Zap Cannon once is not a guarantee. It's abilities won't save it either: Magnet Pull is pretty useless in a game without frequent enemy AI switching, not to mention how _Nosepass is weak to Steel anyways_. Sturdy would later become a solid ability for a Pokemon like Nosepass... but for now it is completely useless as Glacia's Sheer Cold Walrein might as well OHKO Nosepass with Surf anyways.

So, Nosepass is a Pokemon that requires a ton of knowledge and backtracking simply to find, and its best contributions are against the fourth and fifth gyms, not the game's hardest. It has awful unit feel, and when a Pokemon is doomed to feel this awful to use, I think its fun to propose some changes. Platinum shows us what happens when Nosepass is able to evolve early into Probopass - it's not necessarily great, but it's not laughable like Nosepass in Hoenn. Here I'm putting myself into the mindset of GameFreak during the creation of Generation III however, so I'll for now pretend that Probopass and its Steel/Rock typing isn't on the table. 

I don't think Nosepass-the-enemy needs to change, which means a few things need to remain the same if I redesign Nosepass-the-unit: all stats except Special Attack need to stay the same, it needs to keep the same defensive type matchups against Normal, Fire, Water, and Grass. They already were willing to lean into the connection between a compass and electrical currents in Nosepass's moveset, so I think adding the Electric type is a perfect choice for Nosepass! This makes Mudkip's Mud-Slap a bit stronger here, but Water Gun will still be better, so it's not a big balance change. Increasing its Special Attack to match would be a good idea to give it _something_ to do: even if it goes up only to 70 over 45, this would put it at 400 BST but allow it to deal real damage with Electric moves against Hoenn's late game Water types. The other thing worth looking into is its "hit" stat: Lock-On is a doomed move from the start - needing to use it every other turn means it ultimately wastes so much time. I'm not sure what would make Lock-On good: maybe setting _all_ future turns to 100% accuracy after its use would be good. Alternatively, since No Guard isn't an ability yet but since Lock-On already fits so well with the compass vibe of the unit, a new ability that increases hit chance for Nosepass should've been implemented here, with an effect somewhere between Compoundeyes and No Guard. These changes aren't altogether huge, but would go a long way to making Nosepass feel more unique.
