### Analysis

**Verdict: A unique typing, rain synergy, and good TMs help save this growth unit from never paying off and being underwhelming.**

The Lotad line is quite the interesting one. As we'll see, it's moveset is particularly rough and its stats will be consistently behind the curve, exasperated by the extremely late final evolution into Ludicolo. Even if they aren't planning on using this line for combat, it can actually learn seven out of the eight HMs (no cut), so it has massive utility for that alone. Sharing a type with two out of three starters, it is likely that Torchic players are the primary group that might feel compelled to add Lotad to their teams - an appealing choice considering the first gym coming up. After players of the other two starters have covered their weaknesses a bit more, picking up Lotad/Lombre after three badges are able to consider it once more (Mudkip will go on to pair well with it under rain), though it doesn't help Lombre skip the awkward middle phase. 

After it's caught in the early game, Astonish helps it contribute against the early game trainers (but not Zigzagoons) just long enough for it to be able to learn Absorb and soon after the uncontested Bullet Seed TM, which alongside Growl and Nature Power, make as good a moveset for Roxanne as any. Speaking of Nature Power, only Seedot and Lotad get this move, though Seedot probably gets marginally better use out of it; Nature Power is a fun flavor option but not set defining for Lotad or anything. Anyways, it has an insanely early evolution into Lombre, further helping it steamroll here, but there is a case to be make to delay this evolution for a while. The player gets one Rain Dance TM after the seventh gym, and Castform comes with Rain Dance. Aside from these two (and Kyogre in Sapphire) the only way to generate Rain is Lotad's Rain Dance, learned at Lv. 31, so delaying evolution by 17 levels may be worthwhile for some team compositions. Doing so only means it misses out on Fake Out and Fury Swipes (both can be relearned) and a 120 total stat difference during this time... so it's worth considering. Mega Drain at Lv. 43 is not notable, so Rain Dance enjoyers can evolve at Lv. 31 into Lombre regardless.

Whether or not the player has evolved Lotad during the Lv. 14-31 segment of the game, it doesn't really have a great time. You know it's bad when the Thief TM is looking like the most consistent damage option during this phase. Bullet Seed falls off incredibly fast and Absorb doesn't do enough damage to help Lotad/Lombre sustain itself, so it will probably take a more supportive role in the team, maybe making use of the Exp. Share. It has just enough Atk that Strength or Secret Power might help it contribute a bit more (or the player can grind coins or money to get an early TM Ice Beam at the Game Corner...). Neutral damage on top of low stats mean it probably isn't going to be too helpful against Brawly or Wattson, but at least it kinda hard walls Rival 2's Marshtomp in the Torchic starter context! It's Water typing helps it against Flanner- oh, hang on, I'm getting a call. Dispatch is telling me that... Lotad doesn't have ANY Water moves yet? Rain Dance and Water Sport come a little too late for Flannery... and there isn't a single offensive Water move here. So it ends up being complete fodder to get taken out by Overheat. Norman gives it a rough time too, shocker.

But then everything begins to turn around. Lombre learns its first Water move in Surf. You can swim over to the Abandoned Ship to grab the free Ice Beam TM. Just around the corner in the northeast part of Hoenn is Giga Drain, allowing it to fulfill its destiny as a special tank that can heal itself. Rain Dish helps it lean into its bulk and Swift Swim gives it much-appreciated Speed, both under rain which it or Castform can set up. Anti-synergistic but still functional is the Sunny Day and Solarbeam combo, also obtained at this time. Rest, Substitute, and Protect are there to help with the tanky side that should come more online once it finally evolves. 

Still, it can't evolve until you've gotten seven badges and gotten a Water Stone - a unique hurdle Hoenn throws at Lombre specifically, really. While it should be able to get levels more easily in Eastern Hoenn than before, it still gets outstatted by bosses like Tate & Liza, but can still probably help under Rain. Unless the player is pining for probably-not-worth Hydro Pump at Lv. 49 With Dive, finally Lombre is able to evolve into Ludicolo, learn Rain Dance by TM if desired, and finally reach its maximum power levels. Most of the members of Juan and Wallace's teams can't really do much to Ludicolo who can hit back hard with its Grass moves, though Juan's Double Team Kingdra can be difficult to take down. It has a decent time getting levels in the rest of Hoenn's ocean and Victory Road and can hit the ground running in the Elite Four, being a valuable generalist team member under rain that doesn't have a ton of type-advantages, but also few type-disadvantages. Notably, it can be a strong contributor against Walrein and Salamence (who doesn't have Flying moves). The nicest thing about dragging Ludicolo through the entire game though is the champion fight: better against Wallace than Steven, but still a great choice for both, Ludicolo has just the tools necessary to take on some of the most annoying enemies in each: Wailord, Whiscash, and Milotic (with Rest) for Wallace, and Claydol, Cradily (with Rest), and potentially Metagross for Steven. Not an easy solo or anything, but it at least feels pretty good to get this almost-starter Pokemon all the way to the end of the game and watch it help in the hardest fights.

Raising a Lotad all the way to evolving to Ludicolo and taking it to the endgame is pretty tough. It requires a lot of babying, working through a pretty abysmal level up move series. If a player uses it for its early first evolution and good matchup against Roxanne, dropping it as a combatant in favor of the best HM movepool in the game, that would make sense. But if the player is willing to take on the challenge of raising one, it will pay off very well in the endgame and is a great example of a late-payoff unit for players that like these kinds of units.\
