# Pokemon Emerald Unit Feel Analysis: Bagon line

Bagon is first obtained at Meteor Falls after the player has obtained all eight badges and waterfall. It can be caught at Lv. 25, 30, or 35: there aren't downsides to catching it at Lv. 35. If so, it can evolve immediately at least at Lv. 30 into Shelgon, then again into Salamence at Lv. 50. Bagon and Shelgon are Dragon types with the Rock Head ability, while Salamence is Dragon / Flying and has Intimidate.

### Analysis

**TL;DR: While training Bagon isn't painless, doing so rewards players willing to push themselves even at the game's end.**

Bagon is found in the very back room of Meteor Falls, only after the player has gotten all eight badges. It rewards the player who is relentlessly curious in their exploration of Hoenn - if they are willing to Fly all the way back across the entire region to investigate a waterfall they visited 20 hours ago, they can find the strongest non-legendary line in the game. Is it worth adding Salamence to one's team right at the end of the game? Is it worth training up to reach that point? Let's find out.

Bagon is an archetypical extremely-late game pseudo legendary that evolves late into the game, yet has a much less difficult time reaching its final form and contributing into the late game compared to others. With its relatively high maximum starting level of 35, you can immediately evolve into Shelgon, who isn't incredible by any means, but is still able to gain levels and hold its own against late game battles. There is a case to be made for saving a few pockets of Hoenn trainers for Shelgon to train against such as those in the sea, since Victory Road trainers can potentially be difficult matchups for it. Shelgon doesn't skate through necessarily, but 95 Atk and 100 Def is enough to allow it some favorable matchups against trainers for some easy Exp. Its high Def, low Spe set up makes it an ideal candidate for the Macho Brace as well - it needs all the EVs it can get to catch up in the late game, and the speed penalty doesn't make it much worse than it already is if it can take hits. There are also enough Rare Candies in Pokemon Emerald that you can easily catch Shelgon up to speed if you want to get quickly to the Elite Four, though that isn't really a point in its favor specifically. It also can learn Rock Smash and Strength if you want to train it while navigating Victory Road, allowing you to temporarily compress party slots.

On the moveset side of things during its training arc, Focus Energy, Headbutt, and Dragonbreath form an acceptable default move core that you can use to start, though the real swag comes in the form of mostly uncontested options for TMs and Tutor moves (E) that it can make use of. Unless you're delaying Bagon's evolution 19 levels (!), the STAB move Dragon Claw is out of reach by level up, but the TM to learn it is available in the same room as Bagon. The move Double-Edge seems to be really overrated by GameFreak in this generation, often being the ultimate move for lines like this one. With only 18 base power over max power Return, Double-Edge's massive recoil makes it an unappealing option in many cases. While only unevolved Bagon at Lv. 53 can conceivably get this move by leveling up before the game's end, Emerald has a tutor for this move - allowing Shelgon to hit hard without taking recoil damage due to Rock Head. With Double-Edge as its bread-n-butter move and other options like Fire Blast and Brick Break, Shelgon is able to considerably hold its own while it crawls towards Lv. 50 and grabs its evolution right before the Elite Four, and can even use Fly to get you back to Ever Grande City!

With its massive 135 Atk and 110 SpA over 100 Spe, Salamence has workable mixed offense, while its defenses are pretty solid as well. Since it loses Rock Head, Salamence wants better moves for the endgame, though thankfully there are tons of options here. Brick Break makes Sidney simple, while Iron Tail or Steel Wing is an option if you need some extra damage against Glacia's Glalies. Earthquake, while contested, and Fly are great physical choices. Fire Blast and Dragon Claw are powerful special options, the latter of which can help you take down Drake as long as it is able to hang on. Intimidate makes it worth a switch in even in less-than-ideal matchups as well. It has an OK matchup against Steven if playing RS, where its Earthquake and Iron Tail together hit for super-effective damage. In Emerald against Wallace, despite pressure from Ice type moves, it still has decent matchups against Ludicolo, Whiscash, and Gyarados to some extent. 

Some players may not want to fill their sixth and final party spot until the last moment possible, and Salamence is a great choice for those players looking to experience the rush of getting one more Pokemon up to speed right at the end, although it's benefits are not too significant compared to a full team with ample EVs built up during the main game. Using a trained Salamence isn't an instant-win button in the endgame, but as a late game choice for players willing to go out of their way to both find one and train one to its final form, it helps the player feel like a master explorer and Pokemon Trainer as they become the Hoenn champion.
