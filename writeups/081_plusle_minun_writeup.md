### Analysis

**Verdict: Whether you use both for the Doubles gimmick or just pick one, Plusle and Minun have enough tricks to be fun to use.**

Minun and Plusle are extremely similar units as individual Pokemon. In terms of stats, Plusle is slightly more suited to offense while Minun is slightly more suited to defense. The singular difference in their movesets is at Lv. 28: Charm for Minun vs Fake Tears for Plusle. These differences are small enough that it is worth looking at them as roughly the same unit in general. However, the abilities in Plus and Minus are just impactful enough that it is also worth considering having _both_ in the same party especially in the more Doubles-dense Emerald, so this analysis will consider using one _or_ both of these units and mostly focus on Emerald. If the player wants to benefit from avoiding the 2% encounter rate and getting the higher EXP gain of the in-game trade Plusle, it comes at the cost of later availability... and having to obtain the 1% encounter Volbeat (or breed Illumise for it). This ultimately comes out to about a wash, but getting to focus on only training Minun for the early mid-game is not a bad idea.

The player is forced into at least one battle with Plusle and Minun right when they become available: while the effects of their ability aren't shown in these battles (no special moves), they still use Helping Hand to show off the intended synergy they have in Doubles. If the player chooses to catch one or both, they do struggle for a while to start (but so does their main role competitor Electrike!). They have to gain 6-7 levels with Quick Attack as their sole attacking move at a point in the game where enemies start to get a bit bulkier. If anything, letting them support other teammates in random trainer Doubles with Thunder Wave and Growl for debuffs and Helping Hand for support will be the best route to get these levels. Spark at Lv. 19 becomes a solid damage option from here; plus, like all other Electric attacks, it gets boosted by Plus and Minus together in Doubles. The Rival 2 fight is around here, where at least they can contribute with Thunder Wave, tutor move Swagger, and Growl to help your stronger teammates get the victory. Although leveling both up this much might not yet be feasible, at Lv. 22 they get the fun-tastic move Encore, allowing them to lock opponents into suboptimal choices easily thanks to high speed. They are able to contribute somewhat against Wattson thanks to all these support options and their own Electric resistances, so they are able to establish themselves as useful single-stage options early enough.

You might notice that there aren't any non-Electric options that are viable - Iron Tail, Return, and Dynamicpunch are probably the best options but work off of low Atk and no Plus/Minus bonuses, so it is worth just leaning into Electric-only damage. Filling only 1 or 2 moveslots with attacks however means we can use more support moves! Niche support options especially in Emerald open up around this time, including Attract, Mimic, pre-buff Charge (boo!) and Metronome (for the real dice rollers out there!). The Shock Wave and later Thunderbolt TMs are good options for countering Double Team and doing more damage, respectively. Charm or Fake Tears are great debuff moves too, considering the AI almost never switches. The moveset interestingly starts to suffer from too-many-options-for-four-slots syndrome... a problem that is alleviated if a player is using both and has EIGHT moveslots for this movepool! Not that using two party slots and all the EXP needed for them doesn't have its drawbacks, but at least using both doesn't make the team drag in the non-Doubles portions or anything. For the midgame they will contribute an average amount - Flannery, Norman, Winona, and evil-team bosses won't be easily swept by the pair, but their speedy support moves are handy in passing momentum to the rest of their teammates. 

Right as the set will feel underwhelming towards the late game, the last pieces fall into place. Thunder, Light Screen, and Rain Dance allow the pair to really clean up in Doubles, especially together. Turn 1 Light Screen and Rain Dance plus Turn 2 Helping Hand to support Plus/Minus boosted 100% accurate Thunder is going to hit really hard, though it's not foolproof. Especially with the help of other rain-loving teammates and Castform for Rain, Plusle and Minun peak in being solid contributors against Tate & Liza once Claydol is taken out. They are able to put in tons of work against Archie and Juan/Wallace, less so Maxie thanks to Ground types. Aside from Victory Road trainers, the endgame has no Doubles, so the player can double down on each in a mostly-supporting role - Thunder, Light Screen, Rain Dance, Encore, Thunder Wave, Toxic, Charm/Fake Tears, are all good options that can help in many scenarios against the Elite Four and especially Champion Wallace. One other cool option that opens up is the combination of Agility, tutor Substitute, and Baton Pass beginning at Lv. 47, one of a few in-game Baton Pass sets that can help a teammate sweep some of the tougher E4 fights.

Plusle and Minun appear underwhelming as many early game single stage Pokemon do: their stats are high early on but fall off towards the end of the game, their abilities are completely worthless in Singles and most scenarios in Doubles, and they have pathetic offensive coverage moves. But hidden between the lines is a really fun and completely unique feeling gameplay experience that results from high speed, synergy with each other, a massive support movepool, and STAB strong against many opponents in the end of the game. Plus and Minus will eventually end up on other, much better Pokemon, but for now Plusle and Minun have a unique niche that is fun to play through and rewards players looking to utilize their unique strengths.
