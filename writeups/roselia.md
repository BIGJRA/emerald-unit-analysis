### Analysis

**Verdict: A cookie cutter Grass/Poison archetype that doesn't really do anything interesting is at least serviceable.**

One wouldn't be blamed for not realizing that Roselia is actually a Generation III Pokemon. It isn't available in the "ultimate version" Emerald, and its most notable appearance is _just kinda being there_ on Wally's final team. With the pre-gym-one Budew and notable early boss Pokemon Roserade serving as evolutionary bookends to Roselia in the very next generation, Roselia definitely feels more of a complete package in the Sinnoh region. Yet Roselia is still available in Ruby and Sapphire, a viable team option for the whole game. Let's see how it feels to use Roselia as a unit in these games.

Oddish is available one (massive) route before Roselia is, and will likely get close to reaching its evolution into Gloom around the time you can get Roselia. The similarities between Gloom and Roselia are fairly apparent: very similar BSTs, very similar movesets, and of course the same typing. There are a few differences: Roselia gets slightly better moves earlier, but peaks much earlier than Gloom who can eventually use a Leaf Stone to get the better stats of Vileplume (or Bellossom, I guess). Roselia does get Poison Point or Natural Cure: a choice of randomly inflicting status on enemies or cancelling the negative effects on itself. Still, Roselia doesn't exactly stand out in comparison; while arguably more of an objection to the inclusion of the Oddish line in Hoenn and on Route 110, the net effect is that Roselia feels a bit less unique.

As a single stage Pokemon, Roselia does have a good start. Stun Spore allows it some room to set up SpA with Growth, then use Mega Drain to heal it back. It resists Wattson's Electric moves and can use its new move Leech Seed to have a good shot at winning a self-healing set up war against his party members. It struggles against Flannery, but the player is likely to only want Roselia if they're training Combusken or Marshtomp who can take care of this fight. It gets Magical Leaf just in time to be the perfect counter to the Sand Veil shenanigans on Route 111, though.

Probably the biggest issue with Roselia's unit design is Grasswhistle, which it learns at Lv. 29. Roselia is the only Pokemon that gets this move other than by breeding, so it's essentially a signature move. And what does it get for its signature move? 20% LESS accurate than Sleep Powder... a move learned 11 levels earlier by Oddish! In a generation that realistically boxes the player out of using Spore in a playthrough, I don't understand why Grasswhistle wasn't made Hoenn's ultimate sleep move to at least give _some_ flavor to Roselia as it moves towards being outclassed stat-wise in the end game. If you want it to status you might as well stick with Stun Spore, switch to post-Flannery TM Toxic, or just rely on the occasional Poison Point. 

The midgame gyms aren't slam dunks for Growth sweeps with Roselia, but it can still contribute against Norman and Tate & Liza with somewhat speedy status moves. Even though 50 HP and 45 Def aren't great, it can transition fully to a status debuffer that keeps itself alive with healing moves as it gets access to Protect, Substitute, and Ingrain (Aromatherapy and Synthesis probably come too late) to round out defensive sets. Offensively it can also swing for STAB TM Sludge Bomb, though its lower Atk doesn't help it get much use out of this move. Probably its best attack is prime PP Up target Giga Drain, learned naturally allowing for another Pokemon on the team to make use of the widely available TM (Petal Dance is weirdly underpowered in this generation considering its drawbacks). Worth noting is that Roselia gets literally no other Special coverage than Grass, so buckle in.

The massive open ocean and 80% of endgame trainers using Water types does at least mean that training Roselia for the Elite Four is easy to do in spite of its paling 400 BST. Unless its teammates are able to put it in exactly the right position, Roselia probably won't be able to do any Growth + Grass move sweeping against any of the Elite Four, so Roselia enthusiasts basically end up forced into using it as a status debuffer that can at least outspeed some of the members of Steven's team and help a teammate get some momentum. Serviceable to the end, Roselia doesn't really have any standout moments or shining qualities and as a result has very middling unit feel.
