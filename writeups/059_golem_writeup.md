### Analysis

**TL;DR: The Geodude line is certainly one of the Pokemon lines of all time.**

From my experience, even non-Pokemon fans tend to recognize Geodude. It has a very simple, plain design and is a frequent encounter in caves dating back to the first generation. One of eight lines that was included in all four of the first regional Pokedexes, Geodude fills a fairly straightforward gameplay role: that off the high-variability, high-risk, high-reward slugger. While some of these eight like Alakazam and Seaking are ultimately superfluous amongst the new Hoenn Pokemon, the only new direct competition the Geodude line has to its role are Nosepass, who fills the "Onix" archetype of weak first-boss, and Aron, whose Steel typing and ironically light-on-Rock-type but otherwise massive movepool help it feel distinct from Geodude. Geodude will go on to evolve earlier and have its final form locked behind trading, which add to its distinct feel. Although Geodude by now is somewhat stale as an addition to many regional Pokedexes, it makes sense in the context of Hoenn despite all the Water and has some moments to shine.

The first gym and early routes are teeming with Geodude: we learn that it hits hard when it doesn't miss, it has high defense and resistances to Normal and Flying, but it crumples to Water and Grass. Especially with a Grass-type like Treecko or Shroomish in a team already, Geodude is an obvious pick to start covering weaknesses. Rock Throw or TM Rock Tomb work on its very high 80 Atk stat to be able to deal heavy damage, though its low speed and weaknesses keep it balanced well. Magnitude comes quickly after, where the variance of move power replaces that of accuracy, enhancing the line's identity even more. Geodude is an amazing teaching tool during the early game as an enemy unit as well as a player unit, and it makes sense why GameFreak couldn't help themselves from including it game after game.

Evolving at Lv. 25 and having the option to do a trade evolution allows the player to power up their Graveler if they have the means and desire, though not evolving unfortunately leaves Graveler on the weak side. Whereas Kadabra and Scyther are perfectly fine without trading, evolutions like this being straight upgrades do highlight what I believe is a flaw in the trade evolution system. 

 It has a bad time against Brawly, sure, but stands out if nothing else for the slam dunk of the next FOUR gym fights in a row where it has type advantages, even though Winona will be on the tough side for it. Along the way it gets Selfdestruct, Dig, Rollout and later Rock Blast, all strong options with various drawbacks. The end of its growth arc finally allows it to naturally learn Earthquake, finally letting it overcome its full moveset of risky moves in favor of a reliable, powerful option! Similarly to Aggron it bears the curse of GameFreak designing like 3 abilities that make sense for Rock Pokemon... Sturdy is useless in this generation while Rock Head lets it use Double-Edge without the second edge, I suppose, though this move must be tutored or learned way too late into the game. Even with its complete kit, Golem is going to struggle in Hoenn's ocean and against trainers like Glacia, Juan, and Wallace, but it is still powerful enough that good strategy can allow it to contribute... exploding, if nothing else. Golem has a great midgame and serviceable endgame and feels decent to use for an old-made-new Pokemon!
