### Analysis

**Verdict: Good BST and an insane movepool don't save Aggron from feeling constantly underwhelming in Hoenn.**

Aggron is a well-loved design by many. Yet playing through Hoenn with Aggron on the team is a mixed bag - it is hard not to be disappointed by the line when all is said and done. Despite having a huge box of tools to use, no matter what Aggron uses, it comes up short when it counts in Gen III. Let's get into why.

Aron is the earliest available Steel type Pokemon in Hoenn (with Mawile in Ruby), and the series overall so far. On top of its Rock typing, this means defensively it is able to eat up common attacking types - Normal, Bug, Flying, Poison, and Rock attacks will all fall completely flat on Aron with its massive 100 Defense. On the flip side, it has double weaknesses to common types Fighting and Ground, and a weakness to the most common type in Hoenn: Water. It's Special Defense Using Aron means that it has certain matchups that are going to be cakewalks and certain matchups it stands no chance of winning. As a note on abilities: Sturdy is a completely worthless ability (only Glacia's Walrein has Sheer Cold, but it also has Surf to get the OHKO naturally), while Rock Head allows marginal and not set-defining benefit.

On the moveset side of things, lets look into the moves that Aron gets. Just for fun, I'll count how many of the 17 types for which the Aggron line has a move of at least 60 Base Power. With Headbutt at base, that makes (1). Metal Claw, Rock Tomb by TM or Rollout by Tutor, and Mud-Slap or Iron Defense fill out its early moveset. Rock Tomb plus Headbutt for flinches can technically work, but Aron's low speed doesn't make it noteworthy or anything. The maximum power here including STAB is 75, a number which we won't see go up unless we use HM Strength for 80 until Lv. 25's Take Down for 90, which at least becomes "usable" with Rock Head. A big stretch for my definition, but Fury Cutter (2) and Rollout (3) eventually pass 60 base power, or you can consider STAB Rock Tomb to be 75 BP. Shock Wave (4) is learnable for accurate special damage to counter its otherwise inaccurate movepool; speaking of inaccuracy, Iron Tail (5) at Lv. 29 is a bit of an offensive saving grace with 150 after STAB. Still, getting to Iron Tail requires dragging 330 BST Aron through the early-midgame of Hoenn, where it gets bodied by Brawly's Arm Thrust and Bulk Up, Wattson's Shock Wave, and Flannery's Overheat. While the typing and Defense stat would suggest that Aron would have a good time against Norman, in my experience it still struggles here against the might of Pokemon like Vigoroth and Slaking.

After getting five badges, Aron should be about ready to evolve once into Lairon. A bit more in each stat, Lairon is a late but still appreciated power increase for Aron. Winona sounds like a slam dunk for Lairon, but it's strongest options against Flying are Shock Wave and Rock Tomb... and her Altaria can simply set up and use Earthquake to wipe Lairon away. It can learn Aerial Ace (6) for some reason here. Continuing to train Lairon against the long stretch of non-gym-leader fights here (learning Protect by level after the TM is buyable) soon leads to its final evolution into Aggron, who again gains a sizable bump in stats, notably massive physical bulk and more Attack and Special Attack.

Aggron's TM and tutor learnpool is absolutely STACKED. Continuing our counter from earlier we get: Double-Edge (Rock Head makes it good!), Flamethrower/Fire Blast (7), DynamicPunch/Brick Break (8), Surf/Water Pulse (9), Thunderbolt/Thunder, Solarbeam (10), Ice Beam/Blizzard (11), and even Earthquake (12) and Dragon Claw (13). It doesn't have offensive moves in Poison, Ghost, Psychic, or Dark... and that's it. I'm not really sure why they decided to give Aggron literally the largest offensive movepool of an ordinary Pokemon in the entire whole of Gen III, but here we are. A player willing to deal with far-too-many levels of raising Aron and Lairon only to evolve at Lv. 42 into Aggron at least is now able to craft basically any offensive moveset they could dream of. 110 Attack and 60 SpA on top of Metal Sound, learned late, mean that Aggron has a moveset that can counter nearly any Pokemon!

Just kidding, Aggron gets pretty owned in the endgame. Whether it tries to set up Defense, goes for kills with its offensive moveset, or goes full special set with Metal Sound, Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, heck, even Dragon Claw, it will have a tough time picking up kills against the late game Water and Dragon trainers. Even if Aggron had 20 move slots and access to all of its tools at once, it's low Speed and Special Defense on top of its weaknesses mean that Aggron simply is not likely to have any standout moments of greatness. Is it serviceable and flexible? Yes. Is it a cool design and is its massive movepool fun to mess around with? Absolutely. But does it ultimately feel good to use Aggron, to drag the late evolving Aron and Lairon through an early and mid-game often hostile to them? I hate to say it, but the payoff isn't really there.
