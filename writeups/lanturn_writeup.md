### Analysis

**Verdict: A very average unit in a great context, Lanturn has a niche among the late game Water types and feels decent to use.**

As compared to some of the other Water types imported from Kanto and Johto, the Lanturn line thematically seems to make sense in the underwater seaweed areas, so its inclusion in Hoenn doesn't feel out of place. As with all the end-game Water types, there is a case to be made that the player already has a Water type in their team in order to at least use Surf and Dive, making it less appealing. Yet with a dual type of Electric, completely unique to this line in this game, Lanturn is able to easily blend into an end game Hoenn team pretty well despite its middling BST. Illuminate is a flavor ability that is arguably more annoying than helpful while Volt Absorb has at least gives it a niche among Water types, though Lanturn doesn't face many enemy Electric type Pokemon in the time its available here.

It is obtained after the player has seven badges, at Lv. 30 at the highest. There is no reason to go for lower level or to delay immediate evolution into Lanturn. The player can use one of numerous Heart Scales to immediately use the 100%-accurate and reliable Thunder Wave plus Confuse Ray combo, which works well on top of Lanturn's 125/58/76 bulk and five resistances. While 76 SpA isn't anything to write home about, the availability of STAB Surf, STAB Thunderbolt/Thunder, and Ice Beam/Blizzard right away is nothing to sneeze at in the context of Hoenn, especially considering these three types provide near perfect coverage going forward! Both Archie and Maxie basically fold to these types, and Juan or Wallace as the last gym leader don't have a ton of options to really touch Lanturn as most of their teams get zapped. Getting Lanturn to an acceptable level to be a power player in these fights does take some work, but doesn't struggle much along the way as it has a really easy time against most of the trainers in Hoenn's vast ocean. 

Aside from Hydro Pump for more power, there aren't really any other interesting moves as Lanturn approaches endgame. With the not-insignificant combination of Flash, Surf, and Waterfall for Victory Road traversal, Lanturn is able to be useful even if it is not trained up much in the late game. Lanturn has the bulk, status moves, and coverage needed to be a major contributor against the Elite Four, especially later on. Glacia doesn't do much damage to it, so a Shell Bell bulky attacker set is solid here. As with any Water type that can touch Blizzard, it is a good choice against Drake and will live a lot of the STAB Dragon attacks due to them hitting SpD. Its two STABs are particularly good against Steven and Wallace in all three Hoenn games, and where it isn't able to win 1v1s it can at least use Confuse Ray to set up a teammate. Lanturn is easy to get going and feels pretty good to use in the lategame, standing out among the late game Hoenn water types.
