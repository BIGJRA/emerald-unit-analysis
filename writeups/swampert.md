### Analysis

**Verdict: There's a reason people "liek mudkipz". An "easy mode" starter with a good training arc throughout the game.**

Getting the starter Pokemon "right" is a pretty important task, I think. They need to present a Pokemon that is instantly appealing and make it's progression across the game obvious and feel satisfying. Mudkip ultimately accomplishes both of these goals, being a fun amphibious design that clearly gets stronger over the course of the game and makes for an excellent partner to the player. It's added Ground typing is a fun shakeup for the Water type starter that benefits the line far more than it takes away from it in the context of Gen. III. 

Mudkip gets off running right away, with Mud-Slap as its first coverage option that thematically grounds the line's "mud" theme and makes battles like the first rival fight and Route 102 trainers more interesting than spamming Tackle. Once it gets Water Gun, it is able to easily deal with the early game trainers, especially Hikers. Assuming the player doesn't overlevel past Roxanne, Mudkip is able to take care of Geodude and stands a chance against Nosepass. If the player has leveled it up to exactly 15, Bide is an interesting tactical option for Nosepass that shows off how the Mudkip line's passable bulk allows it to use alternative strategies. The Rock Tomb TM is a good choice for this line for some early game anti-Bug and Flying coverage.

The benefits for not evolving into Marshtomp right away include access to Whirlpool and Hydro Pump, hardly worthwhile reasons to stick around compared to the opportunity cost of not evolving right away: The Ground typing, more stats, and STAB Mud Shot scaling off of physical attack.
