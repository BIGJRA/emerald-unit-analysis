### Analysis

**Verdict: Wigglytuff is a random choice for an obscure Pokemon in Hoenn?**

The Jigglypuff line returns for the third time in this generation, yet is less visible than ever before. Enemy trainers rarely use it, and it is tucked away in a back corner of Hoenn and available later than in all of Gen I and II. On one hand, hiding Jigglypuff only on Route 115 makes a ton of sense and encourages exploration for the thorough player. On the other hand, it is just kinda there: a strange unit whose typing and stat line spread is mimicked and surpassed by the Whismur line and whose ability (and Moon Stone based evolution) is also present on the Skitty line. Why Jigglypuff, then? My first hypothesis was to show off Baby Pokemon and breeding... but Crystal in particular did this already by placing Jigglypuff right in front of the daycare and making Igglybuff an Odd Egg candidate. My next hypothesis was that they wanted two evolution candidates per stone type, but the Sun, Thunder, and Fire stones disprove this as well. So Jigglypuff really seems like it was plucked at random to fill the "Route 115 hidden mon" slot - giving the option to the off-the-beaten-path-hunter to bond with their treasure if they want but otherwise not really making too much of an impact as a unit in game.

As a unit there isn't a ton else to say about it. The tradeoff of breeding and starting with a lower-leveled Pokemon is Charm and Sweet Kiss, which are OK support options at least. Rest by leveling is a nice boon as is Body Slam, but evolving right away to shake off Jigglypuff's terrible stats is worth doing. Otherwise its the same old story of the Normal type with the wide movepool. Statwise, Wigglytuff is a slow punching bag with a large HP stat, which at least makes the negative effect of STAB Double-Edge a bit less bad? Offensively it doesn't hit hard with anything really so in hard fights is a supportive Pokemon that might be able to score some KOs on frail mons or those four-times weak to something like Blizzard. Wigglytuff is just "there", but "there" at least rewards explorers and completionists.
