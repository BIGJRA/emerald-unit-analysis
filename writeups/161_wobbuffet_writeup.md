### Analysis

**TL;DR: Wobbuffet's simple gimmick is enhanced by its new ability and its new baby pre-evolution.**

Wobbuffet is one of Generation II's gimmick Pokemon. It's only damage comes in the form of Counter and Mirror Coat: correctly predicting the classification of a damaging move used against it, Wobbuffet soaks up the damage with its huge HP stat and deals double damage back. Safeguard allows it to prevent status afflictions to make Counter and Mirror Coat more reliable, while Destiny Bond allows it to take out one more enemy Pokemon if timed correctly. Its 33 Atk and SpA are then completely irrelevant, while its 33 Speed at least allows the player to expect to go last. On the face of it, the 58 Def and SpD seem bad, but Wobbuffet wants to actually take damage, so it all comes together. 

Gen III makes a few changes that make Wobbuffet a little bit more consistent and viable. First is in its new exclusive ability, Shadow Tag, which makes it impossible for opponents to switch out on it. On the one hand, this means that Wobbuffet can switch in on a Pokemon with a known moveset of all Physical moves and use Counter on it. On the other hand, though, enemy trainers very rarely actually switch out, so the benefits to having Shadow Tag are hard to appreciate. The other comes in the form of its new baby pre-evolution, Wynaut. While Azurill adds nothing to the Marill line from a gameplay perspective, Wynaut comes with some neat tricks. One notable aspect is its availability: one Wynaut egg is obtainable about 2.5 badges worth of content before Wobbuffet becomes available. Wynaut only has Splash, Charm, and Encore hence needs to be switch/Exp. Share trained, but reaching Lv. 15 will not take too long. It learns all of Wobbuffet's moves at this level and then evolves. The advantage to starting with Wynaut is hidden in the three moves that it starts with. Aside from Splash, a meme move, and Charm, a status move that doesn't work too well with Wobbuffet's gimmick, Encore is the real winner, allowing Wobbuffet to lock the opponent in to a given move - useful with Counter and Mirror Coat! Plus, the new item Shell Bell in hand, and teammates with moves like Wish can help it soak up even more damage!

Wobbuffet is made a bit better in these games, sure, but is it fun and rewarding to use? It probably depends on the player. Part of the problem with how these games are set up is that something like 90% of the trainers in the game are fodder, with Pokemon at lower levels than the player's Pokemon. While this allows the player to get experience on their Pokemon to level them up, it means particularly that actually training a Wobbuffet without Exp. Share is a huge pain. While even a somewhat weak Pokemon like, say, Spinda, can knock out hordes of enemy trainers' weak Pokemon like Poochyena and Wingull, Wobbuffet can only do so insofar as they are able to damage Wobbuffet... which isn't much. For Wobbuffet to take down a single Wingull, assuming it isn't just using moves like Supersonic and Mist the whole time, it takes multiple uses of Counter and/or Mirror Coat. Spending all this time training it up feels pretty terrible all things considered.

But on the other hand, Wobbuffet is really a get-out-of-jail-free card for some of the tough boss fights in the game. The best way to explain this is really just to use an example: on my last playthrough I had no Ice-type moves on my team, so Drake's team was a bit threatening. Or, it would have been, if not for a Lv. 50 Wobbuffet. I was able to anticipate Salamence would use Crunch, taking it down to just below half health, so I one-shotted the ace with Mirror Coat. Next out was Flygon, who would barely leave Wobbuffet alive after one attack, meaning it was the perfect time to use Destiny Bond. Even the Elite Four AI doesn't know how to counter an active Destiny Bond, so Wobbuffet took down Flygon the next turn; I picked two of Drake's strongest Pokemon to trade for Wobbuffet. 

Wobbuffet is a pain to train, but its gimmick is an incredibly fun and rewarding one. Gimmick Pokemon tend to be hit or miss for players, but for those players who find the satisfying payoff worth the difficult training arc, this line is a great inclusion.
