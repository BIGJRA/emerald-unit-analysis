### Analysis

**TL;DR: With a unique ability, impactful decisions to make, and a satisfying growth arc, Slaking is Gen III unit design at its best!**

The player starts by catching a low level Slakoth, noticing right away that Slakoth has an ability that literally lets it only act half of its turns! With this major limitation and just Scratch (or HM Cut, with the downside of not being able to delete it) as an attacking move, Slakoth begins the slow march to Lv. 18 to reach its first evolution. Along the way it gets some pretty good support moves: Yawn is reliable sleep, Encore forces the opponents to waste turns on potentially bad moves, and Slack Off lets it heal. At least Yawn will probably let it contribute against Roxanne's Nosepass, for what it's worth. Yet the impact of all of these moves is a bit hard to see with Truant getting in the way, so pushing through to Lv. 18 is necessary to get the full impact of this.

Once Slakoth evolves, everything changes. Notable is Vigoroth's ability, Vital Spirit, which isn't notable on its own but is at least not Truant! Vigoroth has stats comparable to Zangoose and Linoone, getting the usual vast TM pool that comes with being a Normal type. Vigoroth's stats are high enough that it actually can contribute against Brawly if evolved at this point - Bulk Up is a fantastic choice for Vigoroth on top of Slack Off, Yawn/Encore, and an attacking move (Strength might be the best option here). Sweeping Wattson or Flannery isn't trivial thanks to its low SpD, but is doable with some team support. Vigoroth in this phase of the game learns a lot of moves that indicate activity and violence - Focus Energy, Slash, Uproar, etc., indicating the general theme of Vigoroth's learnset as opposed to Slakoth's more lazy, supportive moveset.

Vigoroth should be somewhere around the late 20's or early 30's when the player fights Norman in his gym. Vigoroth can do quite well in this gym with its stat-boosting set, though that's not what I want to focus on here. In all versions of the game, the player has to fight both Vigoroth and Slaking on his team, where they learn a few important things: Slaking has Truant, and Slaking has insanely high stats (150/100/60 bulk is insane, not to mention highest in the game 160 Attack). The Vigoroth trainer at this point has gotten to learn how intrusive Truant is via training Slakoth in the early game, and they now have seen how effective Vigoroth can be with its moveset thus far. After beating Winona, where again Vigoroth can be a solid contributor, Vigoroth will be nearly ready to evolve - the observant player should now have enough information to help them choose whether this evolution is going to be worth it! Choosing to or choosing not to evolve is already an interesting proposition for the player... so the game making this choice easier with relevant information is unique and well done. Both learn Counter, while Vigoroth will later learn Focus Punch (which pairs with moves like Yawn and Bulk Up well) and Reversal by level up if the player wants to delay evolution. Slaking will get massive stats and Truant in exchange for Swagger and Flail.

This evolution all happens right around the time that a few tools open up that make Slaking succeed where Slakoth earlier failed miserably. Most notably that the downtimes of Hyper Beam and Truant are combined, meaning Slaking with its massive 160 Atk might as well use Hyper Beam if it is otherwise going to loaf around. Slaking with Hyper Beam is absolutely absurd in terms of power level and nothing feels quite the same as decimating almost any Pokemon at will with a single move. Also around this time is the TM for Skill Swap, a niche move only really useful in Doubles that lets an ally switch Truant off of Slaking! Emerald has far more double battles and a bigger team for Tate & Liza, where this strategy can be a bit more potent. Slaking has a ton of physical options like Brick Break, Earthquake, and Shadow Ball for coverage, but with 95 SpA, Slaking is very capable of using powerful special attacks too - Thunderbolt/Thunder and Ice Beam/Blizzard are particularly useful going into the endgame. Slaking can crush most of the remaining boss Pokemon in its way - the vast majority of the Pokemon on the teams of gym leader Wallace / Juan, Sidney, Phoebe, Glacia, Drake, and Champion Steven / Wallace are weak to at least one of Slaking's five aforementioned coverage moves, and the rest might as well get blasted with Hyper Beam. 

Pushing through using a Slakoth for 12 levels allows the player to get solid contributions out of Vigoroth, who can continue to contribute all the way up to the endgame if the player desires it. Evolving it into Slaking and giving it the right tools allow it to be a multi-use delete button against all of the game's most difficult trainers. On top of the game giving the player information about what to expect with this evolution line via Norman's team, the Slaking line rewards players who pay attention with multiple options for its use and, during the first generation featuring abilities, is a shining example of how Pokemon can be designed in unique ways.
