### Analysis

**Verdict: Pinsir is a late-game Safari Zone sweeper that fills the role excellently.**

Pinsir has an incredible BST, with a large Attack stat and decent Speed. With Heracross it is locked to the hidden areas of the Safari Zone, making its capture obscure and difficult, but getting one will generally pay off! Although it isn't quite as good as Heracross thanks to having a large Fighting movepool that it doesn't get STAB on, it still has the solid, normally TM-locked Brick Break at base, which allows it to instantly become a contributor and route cleaner. Fury Cutter is its singular STAB option, which unfortunately doesn't have the immediate power needed to be its best option, meaning it usually has to rely on other types to deal damage.

Like Heracross, it has a somewhat poor matchup against the Psychic gym twins in part thanks to its only Bug option being Fury Cutter at this point, but against Juan and the Elite Four at large it can generally succeed. Saving the Bulk Up TM allows it to set up effectively immediately. It learns the min-maxed Sword Dance right before the Elite Four, and hit really hard. Its Fighting and Normal moves are its default, but it is one of the game's best candidates for the Earthquake TM as well, rounding out a very powerful moveset. It's very straight forward - the Hyper Cutter ability is even there to prevent Intimidate from damping its potency! While some may dislike Pinsir due to its lack of good STAB and comparison to Heracross, it is very powerful in its own right. Though it isn't center stage in Hoenn, it's a fun and strong rare Pokemon!
