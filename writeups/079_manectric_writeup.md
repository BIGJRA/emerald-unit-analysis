### Analysis

**TL;DR: Manectric fills the Electric-type role well, but is kinda boring.**

Electrike is the first available Electric type in Hoenn, alongside Plusle and Minun. While Plusle and Minun focus more on utility and doubles support, Electrike fills more of the typical Electric-type offensive role. It's a solid Pokemon with stats in the right places and works just fine. It shares the Static ability with all three of the returning Kanto Electric lines, though Lightning Rod is at least unique amongst the Electric types. Sure is a shame it just redirects Electric moves to it without absorbing them or raising stats. Let's see what using a Manectric in Hoenn is like!

Electrike has decent availability at least: picking one up on Route 110 is technically doable before Brawly. Getting one here means putting up with 45 Atk-based Tackle/Quick Attack and Howl on top of awful defensive stats or opting for special damage with, uh, Thief? Spark at Lv. 20 is the saving grace that allows it to function from here, though the trainers in and around Mauville and Lavaridge are generally pretty mean to Electric types and the last six levels to evolution aren't as easy as one would hope. Still, Thunder Wave is useful enough against Wattson and in double battles during this period.

The early Manectric can be evolved by Flannery, where it will be able to be a solid contributor: its 105 SpA and Speed come online to help it deal quick heavy damage, a role it will sustain the rest of the game. Electric, past the jungle, is probably the best offensive type in the game, so Manectric is decent from then on. 

A glance at its moveset will reveal that its only serious non-Normal coverage move is Bite at Lv. 39... which ends up being *weaker* than STAB Thunderbolt when not doubly-resisted. Still, Thunder Wave or random paralysis chances pair well with Bite's flinch chance. The rest of its level moves are fairly unremarkable: Odor Sleuth is less useful than Shock Wave, Roar isn't very useful in PVE Pokemon, Charge is nearly useless and too late, though Thunder saves a bit of cash at least. It gets other TMs and Tutor moves... but really the bare minimum of each list that most Pokemon get, plus Iron Tail?

Is that all bad though? It has a bit of a growth arc to becoming competent, after which Manectric hits fast and hard with a great type and can apply reliable status conditions in bad matchups. It is especially useful against Champion Wallace in particular. Ultimately the conundrum is this: the Electric type offensive archetype is a good one in Hoenn and Manectric fills the role well. Yet it does absolutely nothing to deviate from its norm, and in a game with Raichu (the original), Electrode, Magneton, Plusle and Minun... it is just a little boring. I'm sure there are tons of Manectric enjoyers for every player who find it uninteresting, which really just speaks to how fun and replayable Pokemon is for its vast playerbase!
