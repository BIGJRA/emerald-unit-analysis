### Analysis

**TL;DR: A total joke... but fun for those that like jokes?**

Look at those stats. Look at 'em! Luvdisc has only 20 more BST than... starter Pokemon Mudkip... yet is available only at minimum once the player has six badges and has booked it to Route 128 for some fishing. Mono-water types with Swift Swim are pretty much a dime a dozen in this region; most competitors are available far earlier. Levelling it is a tall order - it fails to secure kills against even random trainers and probably will hog the Exp. Share while it's on a party. Luvdisc also serves the mechanical purpose of being a repeatable source of Heart Scales... in a game with a very small pool of viable move-relearner opportunities and 14 Heart Scales that can be found for free. Even in this purpose it is pathetic - there really isn't anything going on with Luvdisc that makes the game easier aside from being able to Surf, Waterfall, and Dive. Yet it still exists, it is still an option for an endgame Pokemon in a playthrough of Hoenn. What is the story that Luvdisc can tell?

Luvdisc has a few traits that help it stand out if you can call it that - most notably its 97 Speed that doubles under rain. You can get it with a Super Rod at Lv. 35, so it doesn't have a huge level hurdle to get over. On the moveset side, let's just start by ignoring its entire standard offensive moveset, since 30 Atk and 40 SpA is not enough to deal meaningful damage in the late game (it getting Flail by level up is really as fitting as they come). Maybe Luvdisc can get a 2HKO against one of Drake's Ground/Flying + Dragon types with Blizzard or something, but I won't hold my breath. What we're left with is Charm, Agility, Swagger, Double Team, no-TM-needed Attract, Mimic, Toxic, Sleep Talk, Rest, Substitute, Sweet Kiss, Protect, Safeguard, Hail, Rain Dance, and the extra turn Protect effect of Dive. Using it basically means one would need to do both of the following:

- Finding some way to prolong the number of turns that Luvdisc can live on its mediocre defensive stats (Double Team, Attract, Sweet Kiss, Protect, Dive, Substitute, Rest)
- Doing something useful against opponents so the rest of its teammates can do the work (Toxic, Charm, Rain Dance, Hail?!, Safeguard??!!!)

So that's pretty much the best you can ask for with Luvdisc. It's speed will allow it to use at least one move per battle. For the price of a lot of HP Up and Zinc, maybe it can live an extra turn and use _two_ moves per battle! Trainers with Full Restores will ruin its only potential "kill" strategy in Toxic stalling... so it's really left being the most pathetic support Pokemon imaginable.

But that's just it: as I've been doing these playthroughs and sending screenshots of the endgame parties to friends, the most common response I've seen is amusement at using Luvdisc! The complete joke can turn into a conversation starter, a marker of only the most insane Pokemon trainers going way out of their way to completely handicap their teams in favor of using a terrible Pokemon like Luvdisc. It isn't close to good, but its not intended to be good - using one tells a story of players looking for a challenge and the hilarious experience that comes along with it.
