# Pokemon Emerald Unit Feel Analysis: Surskit line

The Surskit line available only in Ruby and Sapphire, though a player can technically mix records to get it in Emerald. Since this is roughly the same process as trading, I will mostly consider RS as the context for using this unit. Surskit is first obtained at Route 102 at Level 3. It can also be obtained at higher levels later in Hoenn, though in all of its habitats, it is only a 1% encounter rate. 

Surskit's typing is Bug/Water and its ability is _Swift Swim_. It evolves at Lv. 22 into Masquerain, whose typing is Bug/Flying and whose ability is _Intimidate_.

### Base Stats

Surskit: **40** HP / **30** Atk / **32** Def / **50** SpA / **52** SpD / **65** Spe

Masquerain: **70** HP / **60** Atk / **62** Def / **80** SpA / **82** SpD / **60** Spe

### Analysis

**Verdict: An extremely rare unit with baffling and underwhelming design... is also a great enhancement to the game for hardcore replayers and collectors.**

To be honest, getting to talk about the unit design of Surskit and Masquerain was one of the reasons I wanted to dive into this series and to talk about Hoenn specifically. Why would GameFreak choose to create a Pokemon so bad, so uniquely unsuited to the challenges of the game, and further, why make it so absurdly rare? These are interesting questions I think, so lets dive into the analysis. 

Surskit is available as early as when the player has fought only their rival, so it's clear that this line was intended to be a Pokemon that one might consider picking up as a second team member... if they get lucky and find one. The average first-time player will almost definitely not know it exists until far later in the game, by which point the rest of their early-game team has probably settled. The lucky and/or in-the-know player may still find and catch one - once they do find one, with STAB Bubble working off of its slightly higher Special Attack on top of Quick Attack, Surskit is able to deal some early route damage and actually has enough speed to go first a lot in the very early game. It's typing (unique until Gen. VII) stands out for being a hybrid of two classes of Pokemon available in early game RSE - the 'one with Water moves' and the 'early bug'. This is a pretty cool dual typing - both its Fire and Grass weaknesses moves are neutralized. The player might at this point be hoping that this typing will prove useful as it evolves later...

Against early trainers it does OK and is able to gain Exp. without too much pain, but its problems become quickly apparent. Against Roxanne, Surskit potentially struggles to OHKO even the Geodudes with Bubble and loses the 1v1 against Nosepass, getting 2HKO'ed at best really. Bubble's potential speed loss and 20BP aren't that helpful for this fight and Sweet Scent isn't really doing its team any favors either, so there's not much utility it has for now. Continuing to Dewford Town, Surskit does have a resistance to the Fighting type moves in the gym, but with 32 base Def and a stagnant offensive movepool, it doesn't help much against Brawly, who can simply set up with Bulk Up while Surskit spams Bubble. Hilariously, its next best special option comes in Slateport in the form of the Thief TM, which can be combined with the Blackglasses by Verdanturf to get a whopping 44BP special move that can at least keep it able to fight some random trainers. The otherwise fairly available support moves in Attract, Flash, and Swagger (E) are worth considering if only because it doesn't have anything better to do in fights.

Evolution technically becomes on the table before Wattson, but there is a case to be made the player is better off not evolving it for this fight. With its severely lacking offensive and support options, and weaknesses to Electric in both forms, it cannot contribute much during this phase of the game in either case. The enterprising player might consider shelling out some combination of $80,000 (grinded through Pickup) and hours playing the casino games to get a copy of TM Ice Beam for Surskit, which does fix its damage somewhat... though that is a lot of grinding to get it to a simply functional state. Instead, Surskit could consider delaying evolution by only 3 levels to get Bubblebeam, a move that at least has *some* base power behind it. Delaying the evolution further gets it access to Agility, Mist, and Haze - the former two are not very useful thanks to Masquerain's lack of bulk, and the latter has counter-synergy with Intimidate, so I recommend evolving after Bubblebeam at the latest.

Speaking of abilities before we move fully on to the Masquerain phase of the game, Surskit's ability is particularly useless as there is no rain in the early game! In a vacuum, Swift Swim is pretty solid, but not on pre-evolved Surskit here. On the flip side of the equation, Masquerain has a much more useful ability in Intimidate... though this doesn't necessarily make Masquerain worth using, as there are many other users of the ability. Still, it allows Masquerain to squeak out some utility even when its stats become inferior later as we'll see, so at least there is that.

A piece of trivia about Gen. III Pokemon is that once upon a time in development, not every Pokemon had an ability. This is all speculation on my part really, but I would wager that Gamefreak designed some Pokemon and Abilities in tandem with each other. Intimidate is in the first third or so of Gen. III abilities by internal order, and Masquerain is the second Gen. III Pokemon in the list with Intimidate. While they would eventually give it to Pokemon like Salamence and Gyarados that are already really good without it... I think there is a hypothetical Gen. III where Mightyena and Masquerain were some of the only users of this ability. At least then this unit would feel a lot better to use in an in-game team.

Compared to its archetypical early-evolving bug brethren in the Wurmple lines, Surskit is not able to contribute anything special in the early game until it evolves. That said, if the rest of the player's team is able to carry them through Wattson and Surskit has evolved, it is able to have some semblance of usefulness going forward for a bit, mostly in spite of getting its first STAB move, the weak physical Gust. Especially when playing Ruby, its Bubblebeam is a good option against the Team Magma fights on Mt. Chimney and later the Weather Institute. It is also reasonably good against Flannery, where it outspeeds her team and where Water Sport can even help a teammate survive Overheat spam and come out on top. Masquerain is still weak to Fire though... which gets to really the most baffling thing about the Surskit line - it throws away the Water typing when it evolves, throwing away a significant chunk of the appeal of using Surskit in the first place, instead gaining the Flying type which adds next-to-no offensive prowess and makes its defensive capabilities worse! Even in one of its best gym fights, Masquerain is held back significantly by its change in type, not to mention how it actually loses 5 base Spe.

Unfortunately, there aren't many good things remaining to say about Masquerain going forward. It gets some levels in the desert and can contribute a respectable "average" amount against Norman with Bubblebeam and Flash. Without STAB, Bubblebeam will fall off quickly, though the (free) Ice Beam TM is a decent choice. After being barely helpful with Intimidate and Ice Beam against Winona, it can learn Aerial Ace... which is its best STAB Physical option until Silver Wind right before the Elite Four. As its stats become even more underwhelming, it gets Stun Spore at Lv. 40, which allows it to function slightly better as a debuff pivot, though this feels remarkably late for a Pokemon desperately begging to be dropped after its 10 minutes of glory. It can set, and technically do something, under both Sun and Rain with Solarbeam and Bubblebeam/Water Pulse respectively via use of TMs. With these moves plus Intimidate, it's final notable passing grade comes when it functions as a competent lead against Tate and Liza. It is maybe useful for paralyzing one of Wallace/Juan's Pokemon or something like that.

With ultimate move Whirlwind at Lv. 53 (which again has anti-synergy with Intimidate), Masquerain's drastically underwhelming moveset comes to an end. Not surprisingly, it doesn't really have any shining moments at the endgame either. It can use its weak STAB Silver Wind against some of Sidney's team, though Sidney is not very challenging for basically any team of Pokemon the player has collected by now. When it comes to being an offensive threat in the rest of the endgame fights... not really. It doesn't really have any great moments against Phoebe or especially Glacia, and it probably gets outsped and killed before its able to try using Ice Beam to get any kills against Drake. Both Wallace and Steven have methods to punish poor Masquerain as well, but again it's role as a debuff pivot can still be technically played around if the savvy player really wants to take this thing to the end.

What is the story that is really told by this unit? At first glance, Masquerain is an example of a Pokemon that is just a complete waste of two Pokedex entries; it introduces a cool type combo and then throws it out the window; it uses a cool design to encourage use of a great ability in Intimidate even though other units can do it better; it's moveset is always lagging far behind every other Pokemon leaving it unable to contribute much; it eats TMs like no other. But is all of this a bad thing for game design? I can't say that it is. I believe that the Surskit line is designed to be this bad on purpose to reward long time players of Gen. III for their diligence and aptitude towards challenging themselves! The first barrier of entry is a big one - simply finding the thing. From then on it's challenge after challenge simply keeping Masquerain in your team, yet there is just barely enough that it can do going into the endgame that it can feel incredibly rewarding to use this thing throughout the game. Compared to the alternative, that the 1% encounter Pokemon is actually the best in the game, I think the way they handled this strange Pokemon is actually really cool and if Pokemon ever returns to linear gameplay, I hope they design more quirky units like this one.
