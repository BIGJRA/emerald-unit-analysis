### Analysis

**Verdict: Available late and buried in a sea of Water types, Starmie is a hidden gem for those in the know.**

We all know the memes about Hoenn having too much water, but one of the most glaring issues with "too much water" is the fact that the only Pokemon that really make sense in the water are Water types, meaning the game has the two problems of being 'flooded' with more Water Pokemon than other types, and overusing the Water types it does have as encounters and in swimming trainers' teams. Every Gen. I or II Pokemon included in the Hoenn dex had to be placed purposefully, so the question for now is: why Staryu? While Staryu is used by some swimming Triathletes, Starmie is present on exactly one trainer in the whole game, located inside the Trick House in the postgame. 

The player is very unlikely to encounter Staryu by accident, as they need to pass Lilycove City to Mossdeep City to get the Super Rod, then return to Lilycove. A player that took the time to explore Route 107 and fight trainers will at least know Staryu is in the regional Pokedex and be able to see its location if they so choose, even if they don't know about the Super Rod. The player has numerous Water type options by the time they reach Mossdeep City, so there is not much incentive to backtrack to Lilycove City for this one. Not to mention the common problem with late-game Pokemon: a glaring lack of EVs. I suspect for these reasons Staryu is a very underutilized Pokemon in these games.

What does Staryu add to the game for the player? Statwise, Starmie is super solid with high Spe and SpA and passable defenses. The immediate standout qualities of Staryu's movepool are its immediately available stacked TM learnset: Thunderbolt/Thunder, Ice Beam/Blizzard, Surf/Dive, and Psychic (from the Game Corner if sought after early) provide a full moveset's worth of wide special coverage. On the support side, speedy Reflect and Light Screen are notable, being especially good in doubles fights like the seventh gym. With these moves, Staryu is pretty much all set up for what it needs to do from base. Plus, it gets Flash on top of the Water HMs, useful for navigating Victory Road in a pinch.

I like analyzing "weird signature moves" - Staryu gets one this generation with Camouflage. Though this would eventually get spread to other Pokemon, it is exclusive to the starfish in Gen. III. Camouflage allows it to transform depending on terrain into Normal, Grass, Rock, Ground... or Water, which it already is. It doesn't get any Grass, Rock, or Ground moves, so it can't get STAB on these types, while it's lower Atk stat doesn't benefit switching to Normal type much. Using it then basically trades one moveslot and turn per battle and Water/Psychic STAB for a different defensive typing. For what makes sense as a biological flavor move, it is remarkably useless all things considered. On the ability front, Illuminate is another flavorful but fairly useless ability, simply raising encounter rate. Thankfully it has another ability in Natural Cure, useful for sure but not set defining or anything.

Water Stone users are discriminated against in this generation - the stone being available only after the player gets Dive. If the player wants to train Staryu, Surf and Light Screen are useful against Tate and Liza, but it lacks the stats to be a threat. Still, for a non-evolved Pokemon going into the seventh gym, you can do much worse. Post Tate and Liza, its level should be somewhere around the late 30's. Starmie has a fun option in Cosmic Power if you delay evolution until Lv. 42, otherwise evolution is a good option for the higher stats.

Whether the player opts for a support or offensive set, its movepool is enough to contribute significantly against all the major fights of the game that remain. Archie, Wallace, Glacia, and Juan fear Thunderbolt, Maxie and Steven fear Surf, and Drake fears Ice Beam. Sidney and Phoebe do have the type advantage on Starmie, but it can still be useful in these fights as well. Every Pokedex needs Pokemon that fill slots, and Starmie's availability and utility give it a niche among the Water type Pokemon of Hoenn. While not really a standout member of Hoenn or anything, Kanto fans are able to trust their experience with this line to get a leg up in the endgame if they take the time to look for it.
