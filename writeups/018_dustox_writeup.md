# Pokemon Emerald Unit Feel Analysis: Wurmple line

Wurmple is a Bug type Pokemon, first obtained in Hoenn's early game between Lv. 2-6. Its ability is Shield Dust. Wurmple evolves at Lv. 7 into a random pick between Silcoon and Cascoon, then again into Beautifly and Dustox respectively at Lv. 10. For this analysis, I will be focusing on the resulting unit if it evolves into Cascoon, whose ability is Shed Skin, then Dustox, whose ability is again Shield Dust and whose typing becomes Bug/Poison. 

### Base Stats

Wurmple: **45** HP / **45** Atk / **35** Def / **20** SpA / **30** SpD / **20** Spe (**195** BST)

Cascoon: **50** HP / **35** Atk / **55** Def / **25** SpA / **25** SpD / **15** Spe (**205** BST)

Dustox: **60** HP / **50** Atk / **70** Def / **50** SpA / **90** SpD / **65** Spe (**385** BST)

### Analysis

**TL;DR: Dustox serves the early-bug role well, yet has a better-defined role than Beautifly going into the late game.**

(See the Beautifly analysis for discussion of Wurmple as a unit; Cascoon functions the same as Silcoon really). If the player has gotten Cascoon via evolution or picked one up in the woods, they will get Dustox at Lv. 10. The latter method isn't too recommended since Poison Sting is only available starting as Wurmple and it's actually a decent move choice for Dustox, though it can survive without it. Dustox gets Confusion as its evolution move here, which doesn't have STAB and must scale off of its 50 SpA, though with the same for Atk, Gust at Lv. 13 isn't much better. Dustox's stats are made up for in other areas though - a defensive stat spread of 60/70/90 is enough that it is actually bulky in the early game. 

In fact, Dustox has quite an interesting matchup against Roxanne: with Harden to boost defenses, Shield Dust to ignore the speed drops of Rock Tomb, and a held berry, Dustox may be able to survive long enough to take out the Geodudes and poison and/or confuse Nosepass in spite of its weakness to Rock. It's not as good as Butterfree in Gen I against Rock-move-less Brock, but it at least can live longer than its cousin Beautifly in this fight. Similarly to Beautifly it has a 4x resistance to Brawly's Fighting moves and can hit super effectively with Confusion and Gust, making it similarly a very useful Pokemon for this potentially tough gym fight. 

This is pretty much the last time Beautifly will ever be super useful, but Dustox has more time to function well thanks to its moveset. While Morning Sun doesn't do much for Beautifly, Moonlight works ok thanks to Dustox's defenses - Protect at Lv. 17 and eventually Light Screen at Lv. 31 come earlier than their TMs can be purchased and can help it be a good support Pokemon especially in Doubles. It has the ability to poison with Poison Sting and later Toxic by level up, allowing the player to use the TM on a different Pokemon. Its offensive movepool barely gives it the juice it needs to be viable for getting levels against random trainers without slowing the game to a complete halt: Psybeam replaces Confusion, while Silver Wind and the single-use Sludge Bomb TM can at least give it STAB damage. Other options like Shadow Ball, Giga Drain, and Psychic do exist but aren't really going to serve Dustox that well.

Although it has similar difficulties against gym leaders beginning with Wattson as Beautifly does, Light Screen and Toxic are generally more helpful moves, and it usually has the bulk to live a few more turns. Worth noting is how its by-level Protect allows it to easily deal with Norman's Slaking, a very funny mismatch. Although it takes a while, Dustox can go one-on-one against many of the endgame Water type Pokemon enemies - Toxic stall ing and surviving their mostly special attacks with its respectable 90 SpD is worth something at least. Silver Wind with a lot of PP Ups and in conjunction with Moonlight can even help it do complete sweeps... not likely to happen to be sure... but still pretty darn cool that the early bug actually has the potential to sweep at least. 

Not that Dustox doesn't fall off - 60 HP and 65 Speed look pretty wimpy for what it's trying to do by the end of the game - but at least Dustox fans aren't stuck carrying around a completely dead weight Pokemon by the end of the game. The early game bug unit having at least some endgame niche and some viability is generally neat to see, so Dustox ends up with decent unit feel as a result... at least better than Beautifly!
