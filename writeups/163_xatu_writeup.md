### Analysis

**TL;DR: Xatu isn't too remarkable, but is flexible and viable for a late-game Safari Zone unit.**

There isn't a whole lot to say about the Natu line in Generation III Pokemon: it is a line that exclusively lives in the Safari Zone, so its relevance to the geography of Hoenn isn't important. It enhances the pool of enemy Psychic types, notably spicing up the team of Gym Leaders Tate and Liza in Emerald. Just after the player gets access to HM Fly, Xatu becomes available, suggesting that a player yet to choose a flier has a good pick in Xatu. On one hand, Xatu has worse stats and way worse availability than the Abra and Ralts lines - each of which also have Synchronize as an ability. Like the other Psychics, it has standard TM options like Calm Mind to set up, and Reflect and Light Screen to set its team up. On the other hand, it does have a few notable moves in its learnset plus a different typing that give it a unique gameplay feel if a player chooses to lean into them. Let's see what a player can get out of using one.

Natu joins above its evolution level. Delaying evolution means getting Confuse Ray ten levels earlier and Psychic without a TM, though Natu's 320 BST makes this a hard sell for the lategame. Without comparing it too much to the other Psychic lines, Xatu has decent enough stats, with a bit more in SpA and Spe. There is just enough bulk, that it is often able to fight while healing itself up with one of two fairly unique options - the rare Wish that it learns at Lv. 35, or Rest by TM, made better with the Early Bird ability. Speaking of healing, it is also the only Psychic type that can learn Giga Drain by TM in these games - which pairs really well with all of the above moves against all the lategame Water types. It shares Future Sight with the Abra line, though it gets more use out of it. The three-turn-combo of Future Sight, Wish, and Fly is incredibly fun: Xatu is able to heal itself and be in the air while the opponent is knocked out by the Future Sight. It's not really _better_ than just spamming Psychic, though that move is available only by spending $70000 or waiting until Victory Road. If not Fly, it can use its bird status to fire off Steel Wing and Aerial Ace off of its lesser Atk stat, which is at least unique compared to the other Psychic types.

Whether the player is looking to have fun with some combination of Future Sight/Wish/Fly gimmicks, Calm Mind/Giga Drain/Psychic sweeping, screen setting, or using the 100% accurate Confuse Ray, there is a lot that Xatu can do against pretty much all of the major boss fights remaining after the Safari Zone. Players looking to use the most "meta" Pokemon have probably already EV trained a powerful Psychic Pokemon from the earlygame... but Xatu is still a decent option nonetheless!
