### Analysis

**TL;DR: Wailord's high HP and Water Spout help it stand out somewhat among Gen III Water types and feels decent to use.**

Like all of Hoenn's mid-game Water types, Wailmer can be obtained at a wide range of levels (the later the better) and learn Surf immediately to immediately get levels. It can do late-game HM duty, notably with Strength and Rock Smash on top of the water-navigation moves. It can learn Ice Beam for some use going into the tropical parts of Hoenn and against Winona. The Wailmer line has equal SpA and Atk, which means it can use its not-insignificant physical movepool to some success - powerful Strength/Return and coverage in Rollout/Rock Tomb help it stand out a little bit and fight all of the enemy Water types in the late game. It comes with 60 Speed and will never gain more, just enough that with a level advantage it will outspeed a good amount of the time, and enough HP to compensate for its low defenses. On the ability side of things, Water Veil and Oblivious prevent burns and attraction respectively, neither of which is a real common problem in this game. One other thing to note about Wailord is that it is required to obtain the legendary golems, so a player wishing to use those will need to train Wailmer or else find one at 1% on Route 129 (where it is at a lower-than-usual level in Sapphire and Emerald specifically, for some reason).

Delaying its evolution by one level allows it to get Water Spout a bit early, unique here only to Wailord and Kyogre. Wailord is quite well balanced around this move - its high HP, low defenses balance mean that it is able to live attacks while Water Spout gets weaker, and its 60 Speed is just enough that it will outspeed some opponents and not outspeed others, and its 90 SpA means it isn't going to easily sweep even when it is able to hit with the full STAB 225 base power. Strategizing around Wailord's Water Spout is a highlight of using the set - tools to help here include Rest by level up, Sleep Talk in Emerald, and Amnesia. Surf is still very reliable damage if the player doesn't want to worry about Water Spout, though Wailord will end up feeling similar to other Water types in this situation. Either way, it is a pretty awesome Pokemon when fighting Tate & Liza, and will have a fairly standard performance as a Water type archetype going into the endgame gauntlet. On top of feeling very fitting in the land-vs-sea themes of Hoenn, its high HP stat, Water Spout, and mixed-attack potential all help Wailord have decent unit feel.
