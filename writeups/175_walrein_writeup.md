### Analysis

**TL;DR: Despite also being a late Water type, Walrein is a decent example of the late-blooming Ice type archetype and is fun to use!**

Generation I set a precedent the series will follow for most of its lifetime: one of the final bosses will use Dragon types, but a small selection of Ice-type Pokemon will be available toward the end of the game to deal with them. Strong Ice TMs, learnable by many Pokemon including Water types, provide an alternate way to get this coverage, but STAB on these moves is still desireable. The developers like to set up Ice types as the Dragon-solution in this way: Hoenn is no different, as its only TWO Ice-type lines are both available in the same location deep into the game, a bit before having to fight the Dragon master Drake in the Elite Four. The biggest issue with unit-feel for Walrein is that it is a Water type available only long _after_ the player has gotten Surf, though similarly to Lanturn its dual-typing helps to dampen this feeling. In some ways a "pseudo-pseudo-legendary", the player has to evolve it twice to reach its final, high-BST form. Bad availability only holds back Walrein who otherwise is a great contributor.

Spheal may have low stats when it is caught relative to the rest of the game, but if caught at a higher level (35 is not far behind a 6-badge party!) can be evolved into the respectable Sealeo. Water and Ice types are very nice to have for the upcoming Mossdeep Gym, though Sealeo's Rock Slide weakness and low speed hold it back here. With solid mixed attacking stats on top of excellent bulk, Sealeo can gain levels fairly easily across Hoenn's lategame ocean trainers. A bit of training focus can see Sealeo evolved into the even stronger Walrein by the Water gym, where its resistances plus its Thick Fat ability will help it wall the difficult final gym leader very well.

A very fun level-up moveset from base is unfortunately dwarfed by a pretty excellent pool of TMs and HMs: Surf on top of Ice Beam/Blizzard and even Earthquake and Iron Tail dominate as offensive moves and allow it to bruise as a bulky mixed attacker. Still, Ice Ball, Aurora Beam, Body Slam, natural Rest, and Hail are all appreciated as options to some degree. Ice Ball is actually a signature move in these games, though Defense Curl is locked to postgame tutor or ONLY FireRed/LeafGreen level up... for some reason. It will do just fine with Ice Beam and Blizzard, though it loses points for its signature move not being able to reach its full potential here. Regardless a decent offensive movepool plus the stats to make use of a variety of defensive moves including Rest/Sleep Talk, Double Team, Toxic, and Hail mean there's a lot to like about Walrein despite its middling Speed.

Once it is fully built, Walrein is ready for the Hoenn Elite Four. It is a good answer to most of Sidney and Phoebe's teams, and can do very well in the mirror match with Glacia's Ice types, especially with Iron Tail for the Glalie. It fulfills its intended role of being a Dragon-slayer against Drake very well then, and is able to contribute a lot against Champion Steven or less-but-still-a-good-amount against Champion Wallace, at the least. If the player is going to add a new Pokemon to their team after they've already cleared 80% of the game, there aren't many better options than a line that evolves twice and does so well against the final boss gauntlet!
