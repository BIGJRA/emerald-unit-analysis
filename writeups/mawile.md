### Analysis

**Verdict: More useful than first impressions would imply, Mawile still isn't great, but has a unique niche to reward the skillful team composer.** 

Mawile is practically a version exclusive to Ruby version - the places it would appear in Emerald are occupied by Sableye, except for the very last one. I'll cover Mawile mainly for its usage in Ruby, but I'll mention its performance if picked up for the late game of Emerald when we get there.

Mawile (and Sableye) occupy the interesting position of being the first available non-evolving Pokemon in Hoenn. This archetype  generally means early game bag-o'-stats that can help with early game fights, yet aren't generally viable later into the game. While Sableye's typing allows it to instantly ball out against Brawly, Mawile subverts this archetype slightly: it seems to just immediately be thrown into disadvantageous fights and doesn't really have a time to shine on its own. Yet there is slightly more to Mawile than meets the eye at base, and going later into the game as its stats fall off, Mawile still has an interesting, unique combo that lets it play an important role in teams all the way through the endgame if the player wishes to do so. With zero STAB attacking moves to its name, Mawile has pretty bad unit feel on the surface but learning about how to utilize Mawile really emphasizes how much replay value these games have if players learn about all the mechanics in them!

First, I'll analyze Mawile at base. 85 Atk and Def are its best stats, allowing it to live physical attacks and deal good early game damage back. The ever-excellent Intimidate ability is a good choice for Mawile that allow it even more survivability against physical attackers, while Hyper Cutter is worse but has a slight niche against Growl and enemy Intimidate, I guess. It's early moveset looks pretty trashy though. Astonish and TM Rock Tomb are its only physical options, while Bite is there to use its weaker SpA stat. On paper, it looks like Mawile will be terrible against the next gym leader, Brawly... but it is the only available Pokemon now with Fake Tears, a move that debuffs enemy SpD by two stages. If any of Brawly's Pokemon (probably Makuhita) are proving troublesome for a player with their early team of their starter (especially Grovyle) and maybe one more Pokemon... Mawile is actually a pretty solid team member here! If it has Intimidate, Mawile buys itself one turn of living, and cancels out Bulk Up. Fake Tears then sets up the bulky Makuhita to then be knocked out by the starter's STAB! Even in spite of it's fighting weakness, Mawile isn't dead weight here.

Going forward, it gets ViceGrip at Lv. 21, good for flavor and hilariously its best damaging option for some time... Mawile will unfortunately never get much out of its 85 Atk. Generally uncontested TMs Attract and Torment may be useful on it if only to fill out its moveset during this time. It can still help against Wattson in a similar way to Brawly, but otherwise groans under the weight of its bad moveset. It is one of many choices for HM Rock Smash and Strength if the player wants to take it out of a combat role; or, the latter steps in as Mawile's strongest move! Especially with Flannery torching Mawile to a crisp, it looks pretty awful at this point in the game.

But then everything changes. At Lv. 31, it gets _Baton Pass_. Although a few Pokemon (notably, Ninjask) get this move later, Mawile is the first. TM Double Team is not really game changing on most Pokemon - it relies on them being able to take some hits while they buff their evasion, and is fallible even after. But when Mawile gets to come in, set up as many Double Teams as it can while it lives, and then at low health send those evasion boosts straight to a healthy Pokemon (shoutout to its synergy with Sand Veil Sandslash/Cacturne, as Mawile learns Sandstorm)? Now you have a recipe for a way to sweep basically most fights with a tiny bit of luck! Now its abilities become even more fitting - Intimidate gives it more time to stay on the field, soaking up physical attacks while it Double Teams! Hyper Cutter prevents the opponent from lowering Mawile's Atk, which means it won't be passing debuffs to its teammates!  Suddenly a mechanically unique role has opened up for Mawile on the team despite its myriad weaknesses, and against Norman it is very well suited to pulling this role off!

Since it still needs levels from random trainers, it should have an attack or two. It gets the relatively open TM Sludge Bomb,   TM Return, or can use SpA-based Crunch by level up. Though a poor choice for the TM, it can learn Brick Break which is at least super effective against some of the Elite Four. But what's this? Iron Defense at Lv. 41? Now Mawile can bulk up its Def two stages at a time and pass that to the next Pokemon, allowing even easier sweeps as long as the enemy uses mainly physical attacks! (It is worth noting that GameFreak really missed the mark with its ultimate move - Stockpile doesn't raise defenses in this gen, so passing it is pretty worthless. Not to mention Swallow and Spit Up being terrible). From there, this silly Mawile build is fully off to the races. For the record, I'm not saying it's very good, especially considering the major fights remaining after Baton Pass. Winona dunks on it with Aerial Ace, but the evasion could still be useful if passed to a Pokemon resistant to Flying, I guess. Tate & Liza hit Mawile so hard with super effective moves like Flamethrower that it probably won't last long. Wallace's use of special moves also limits how tanky Mawile can be. 

That said, I think it actually fairs decently well against some of the Elite Four... and especially CHAMPION STEVEN! Taking advantage of the fact enemy AI basically never switches, you get to set up on Glalie, Shelgon (though you'll probably pass debuffs to Spe), and Steven's Skarmory to get some evasion and defense to a teammate! I said I would mention its Emerald performance: it is significantly worse in this context where it must face Wallace as Champion instead, not to mention the late-joining lack of EVs problem, but it at least has Baton Pass and Iron Defense immediately and can snag Substitute by Tutor if you want to pass one to a teammate. There are worse roles than Baton Pass utility for a very end game Pokemon, at least.

Mawile at first glance is awful. With a type disadvantage right away, stats that don't scale well, and not a single offensive STAB to its name, it looks like a pretty bad Pokemon! But with a very specific Baton Passing niche (that happens to pretty much hard counter the final boss of Ruby), Mawile has the potential to contribute to awesome team synergy and really spice up a playthrough of Ruby (and lesser Emerald).
