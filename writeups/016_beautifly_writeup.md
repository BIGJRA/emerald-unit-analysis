# Pokemon Emerald Unit Feel Analysis: Wurmple line

Wurmple is a Bug type Pokemon, first obtained in Hoenn's early game between Lv. 2-6. Its ability is Shield Dust. Wurmple evolves at Lv. 7 into a random pick between Silcoon and Cascoon, then again into Beautifly and Dustox respectively at Lv. 10. For this analysis, I will be focusing on the resulting unit if it evolves into Silcoon, whose ability is Shed Skin, then Beautifly, whose ability is Swarm and whose typing becomes Bug/Flying. 

### Base Stats

Wurmple: **45** HP / **45** Atk / **35** Def / **20** SpA / **30** SpD / **20** Spe (**195** BST)

Silcoon: **50** HP / **35** Atk / **55** Def / **25** SpA / **25** SpD / **15** Spe (**205** BST)

Beautifly: **60** HP / **70** Atk / **50** Def / **90** SpA / **50** SpD / **65** Spe (**385** BST)

### Analysis

**TL;DR: As a member of the early bug archetype, Beautifly has few "moments", but very little long term potential.**

The Wurmple line is a bit of a play on Caterpie and Weedle from Generation 1: it evolves at the same levels, but splits its evolution randomly instead of just being two separate lines entirely. The complete random chance evolution means that a player really pining for one of its evolutions might just waste time trying to get one. Not that it matters, but Shield Dust is the perfect ability for fighting enemy Wurmples with your Wurmple as Poison Sting won't trigger its secondary effect, at least making it not too bad to raise one. Since there is no benefit really to getting one a few routes earlier, a player might as save and reset, catching one at Lv. 6, and raising it one level to check which evolution it becomes. Whether or not it becomes Silcoon or Cascoon, it gets the Shed Skin ability which helps it survive the woods. Raising it to Lv. 10 from here is not too bad as Harden, Poison Sting, and Tackle are just enough to let it gain levels against the pre-first-gym trainers.

Out of the cocoon bursts Beautifly at Lv. 10. It gets the first of its Grass moves here: Absorb, which works off of its initially impressive SpA stat of 90 in the early game to help it deal damage and stay alive. Gust at Lv. 13 gets STAB and works off its 70 Atk to deal respectable damage against the early game Grass, Bug, and Fighting type Pokemon it'll encounter. Beautifly fits the archetype of early bug in the sense that it evolves super early and is able to contribute right away... to some extent. While Butterfree is able to deal heavy damage to Rock in Generation I and survive thanks to a lack of Rock type moves, Roxanne's team is fully equipped with Rock Tomb, capable of taking out Beautifly. Especially with some power levelling, Beautifly may be able to take out Roxanne's Geodudes, but pretty much always loses against Nosepass without an incredible amount of luck or getting to +6 Defense or something like that. It's real "moment" comes against the fighting types of Brawly's gym: it resists their attacks and hits back hard with super effective Gust, or can paralyze them with Stun Spore.

That's... about all the positive moments that Beautifly will really have, but that's ok. The relatively low effort needed to evolve Wurmple and Silcoon only for it to pay off a bit against the first boss and a lot against the second means that Beautifly can serve a useful purpose for playthroughs: a player that picks one up should be adequately "whelmed" and can use it for Flash utility or leave it in the PC. Still, I think the mark of a really effective early-game Bug is the potential to still be worth keeping in a team if a player becomes attached to it, so it is worth considering how Beautifly does as the game progresses.

Just looking at the bosses going forward, it is apparent that Beautifly has a really tough time. With 60 HP and 50 in both defenses, there is little hope that Beautifly lives super effective attacks. With Electric, Fire, Flying, Rock (on Tate & Liza), and Ice (on Juan/Wallace) moves to worry about on gym leaders, this means that Beautifly is rarely going to catch a break to be useful and cannot tank with Morning Sun particularly well. 65 Speed is far too low for it to be reliable as a status spreader or debuffer in many of these fights as well. It's kinda stuck being a glass cannon whose cannonballs aren't very dangerous or a less-than-ideal debuff bot in all these fights.

In this role, Beautifly has a barely passable moveset across the game. On the special side of things, spending $70000 on a Psychic TM provides its strongest move, while it mercifully gets Mega Drain, then eventually Giga Drain by level up to save the TM and allow it maybe to heal enough damage to live an extra turn. Alternatively, TM Solarbeam can synergize with Morning Sun, assuming it is not fighting Fire types, though this is best put on Chlorophyll Grass types. On the physical side, it gets its sole new STAB moves in Silver Wind by level up and Aerial Ace by single-use TM, or can use the Shadow Ball TM if nothing else wants it, I guess. Silver Wind at least has synergy with Swarm (and a whole lot of luck): Surviving at low HP, using boosted Silver Wind and gaining omniboosts might allow it a bit of survivability and damage potential. There are just enough Grass, Psychic, and Dark types in Hoenn for this to be useful at times. Altogether its best non Normal-type damage options are all capped at 90 BP after STAB, which simply doesn't cut it for a Pokemon with 70/90 offenses and no set up moves! Butterfree stands out for its support movepool allowing it viability in the endgame, but Beautifly ends up with a more watered down support set ultimately. Stun Spore (an inaccurate choice), Attract (not useful if it is trying to set up teammates), Whirlwind, and Toxic (ubiquitous) are its status move choices, all subpar thanks to low speed and survivability.

The Bug/Flying combo is already played out in the series and in Hoenn - the most radical thing that could be changed for Beautifly if retaining its stats might be to go for Bug/Grass typing or perhaps Bug/Psychic. In either case it would become slightly better against Roxanne, at least. With its current typing, Beautifly's power ceiling is just far too low for it to contribute meaningfully as enemy stats surpass it, but it isn't the best at filling other roles. As mentioned earlier, it fulfills the early-game bug archetype well, but isn't as cool as its cousin Dustox longterm and ultimately seeing Wurmple evolve into Silcoon isn't the best feeling in the world.
