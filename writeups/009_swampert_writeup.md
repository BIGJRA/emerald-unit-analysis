### Analysis

**TL;DR: There's a reason people "liek mudkipz". An "easy mode" starter that is easy to bond with.**

Getting the starter Pokemon "right" is a pretty important task for Pokemon games, I think. They need to present a Pokemon that is instantly appealing and make its progression across the game obvious and feel satisfying. Mudkip ultimately accomplishes both of these goals, being a fun amphibious design that clearly gets stronger over the course of the game and makes for an excellent partner to the player. It's added Ground typing is a fun shakeup for the Water type starter that benefits the line far more than it takes away from it in the context of Gen. III. 

Mudkip gets off running right away, with Mud-Slap as its first coverage option that thematically grounds the line's "mud" theme and makes battles like the first rival fight and Route 102 trainers more interesting than spamming Tackle. Once it gets Water Gun, it is able to easily deal with the early game trainers, especially Hikers. Assuming the player doesn't overlevel past Roxanne, Mudkip is able to take care of Geodude and stands a chance against Nosepass. If the player has leveled it up to exactly 15, Bide is an interesting tactical option for Nosepass that shows off how the Mudkip line's passable bulk allows it to use alternative strategies. The Rock Tomb TM is a good choice for this line for some early game anti-Bug and Flying coverage.

The benefits for not evolving into Marshtomp right away include access to Whirlpool and Hydro Pump, hardly worthwhile reasons to stick around especially considering you get Surf by that point anyway. Plus, the opportunity cost of not evolving right away is missing out on the Ground typing, more stats, and STAB Mud Shot scaling off of physical attack. Marshtomp is fairly neutral against Brawly, so the player generally should consider a second or third team member to help with this fight. A few more levels later the Mudkip line runs into its biggest hurdle in the entire game though... it's the May (or Brendan) fight on Route 110 - Grovyle outspeeds and tears Marshtomp to shreds! This is a good gate-check for players, ensuring they have added another Pokemon to their team to cover their starters weakness. In my opinion, knocking down the player's starter is where rival fights excel the most and this May fight is a great example of this in action.

Wattson, generally one of the harder gym leaders in Gen. III, is completely steamrolled by Marshtomp, and it's not really close. The Team Magma fights in the upcoming section and fourth gym leader Flannery are pretty similar. I think one could make the case for the game's difficulty curve with Mudkip as a starter that Marshtomp should not yet have the Ground type in order to make these fights more of a challenge, but I digress. 

Marshtomp is held back a bit due to its lack of tools after this point, but it's not too bad. Using it's Water STAB and Torrent becomes difficult as its best option is still Water Gun. Buying Ice Beam at the Game Corner is not necessary and unfeasible, and it's next best offensive options during this time are the still-relatively-weak Dig TM and TM Return, which it will at least have decent base power on by this point. The game finally meaningfully checks Marshtomp with the Norman fight, where its stats and lack of effective status moves do pale against the Slaking combo. Norman is a good "Act I" boss for Gen. III, so it makes sense that the player must lean into different strategies than starter spam. Better-but-not-quite-optimal tools like Surf, the free Ice Beam TM, Focus Punch TM, and Mystic Water come into play after this. Marshtomp still doesn't stomp the Route 119 Rival fight or Winona, again making the player lean on their other Pokemon for a little while.

The slightly dry spell for the axolotl ends around this point in the game though, as it fully evolves into Swampert. With Speed as its only notable subpar stat, defeating the Lilycove City rival's... Grovyle... marks one of the last noteworthy obstacles to Swampert in the run. It is worth noting that GameFreak kinda misses on really selling Swampert's signature move, Muddy Water. Unlike Blaze Kick and especially Leaf Blade, Muddy Water is immediately outclassed (by Surf, which has the same power and 15% more accuracy, and also field usage). While this is a flavor fail for the mud-theme to some degree, I don't think this is a huge detriment to the unit feel of the line overall. Speaking of, the Surf HM is very stacked for Swampert during this time, allowing it to use its decent 85 SpA, STAB, and Torrent in a pinch to deal heavy damage in Single and Double battles, particularly against Tate and Liza if Sunny Day is nullified. 

Physical options like Hyper Beam and Brick Break are good stop-gaps for Swampert until it grabs it's best move for the end game, Earthquake, either by the one-use TM or by waiting until Lv. 52. With access to all the water and cave HMs sans Flash, its moveset can be shifted around for utility while exploring Hoenn's oceans. It has good matchups against Archie and especially Maxie and contributes a reasonable amount against Wallace or Juan for the eighth badge. With Brick Break, Earthquake, and Iron Tail as physical options, and Surf, Waterfall, and Blizzard as special options, Swampert does pretty great as a bulky attacker against the Elite Four and champion. It also has the bulk to take advantage of status-moves like Toxic, Protect, Rest, Sleep Talk, etc. in the endgame if your team needs that role filled. As long as it can avoid getting oneshotted by the Grass types in Sidney's team and Wallace's Ludicolo, Swampert can be a crucial player against all of them with the right team support.

Memes about Mudkip filled my childhood and it's clear to see why. A fantastically designed Pokemon that fits really well into Gen. III games, Swampert is a great choice of starter and is a great example of Pokemon unit design at its best.
