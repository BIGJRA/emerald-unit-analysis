### Analysis

**Verdict: Outclassing its version exclusive counterpart, Zangoose rewards players looking to add a late-early game teammate instantly.**

Although it isn't available in Sapphire or Emerald, Zangoose is there for players of Ruby specifically that want to add a very easy-to-use sweeper to their team. Without any interesting gimmicks, its stat spread and concentrated movepool allow it to easily fill a standard role on many teams. The player can get it after three gym leaders have been defeated, including Brawly, so it doesn't really face any major hurdles. It has the (signature, for the Hoenn Dex) Immunity ability, which is neat for a bit of flavor in its feud with Seviper, otherwise not emphasized much without any interesting interactions between the two in battle. I don't think Zangoose is the kind of Pokemon that immediately makes its role in a playthrough obvious as compared to something like the Zigzagoon line early game or the gimmicky Castform later, but it at least doesn't let players that use it down.

That said, Zangoose is fairly straightforward if picked up, and basically is at peak performance right away. On the moveset side, it has Swords Dance the minute you pick it up, earlier than all other lines in Hoenn that get this move. It gets the very powerful Slash right away and later Strength, Return, and Crush Claw as it's standard attack. The Dig TM can be used for coverage and advantage on the next gym leader, Flannery. On top of its 115 Atk and 90 Spe, Zangoose is able to pick up immediately from its slightly lower level and start sweeping. It even gets _all three_ of Flamethrower, Ice Beam, and Thunderbolt in case the player has time/money for the Game Corner and needs some coverage - the 60 SpA will work in a pinch earlier in the game.

There isn't a ton of deep analysis needed for Zangoose going forward - it is just good! It is a great choice to sweep Norman if it can survive a turn or two of Slaking's attacks, and will be solid at minimum against Winona (or can easily fully sweep, if Thunderbolt is used). It can learn Aerial Ace and Shadow Ball, the latter of which allows it to get around its general weakness against Tate & Liza if it is given support in doubles, and Phoebe in the Elite Four. Brick Break and Iron Tail allow it some  options for Sidney, Glacia, and Steven in the late game where the Normal STAB is not very effective or barely misses +2 OHKOs. Even in the endgame, getting off one or two Swords Dances is possible thanks to team support and its passable bulk. Once that happens... Zangoose can pretty much solo any fight. It's just good!

Zangoose is a fairly strange Pokemon that doesn't take up much presence in the game as an enemy or as a wild Pokemon, but it is such a powerful team option that it has good unit feel on that basis alone.
