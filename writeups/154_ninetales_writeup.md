### Analysis

**TL;DR: A fun returnee pick for a late-game Fire type team option.**

One of the more difficult challenges GameFreak encountered with Fire-type Pokemon is placing them naturally in the world. If not for the Fire type starters, many early Pokemon games don't have many Fire-type Pokemon available early; those that are available are clustered together. Hoenn clusters Numel, Slugma, and Torkoal all together in Mt. Chimney, so non-Torchic players looking for a Fire-type line will need to look elsewhere - Vulpix is the single pick included for this purpose, yet is very late-game and on Mt. Pyre. As the sole Fire Stone evolution in Hoenn, Vulpix is able to come online right away if the player desires. Its moveset and stats help it feel distinct from the other Fire types too, making Ninetales a unique and rewarding late game team option... in spite of the obvious fact a Fire type caught right before Hoenn's ocean will surely drown. Or will it?

Vulpix is nearby or at Flamethrower level at base or can use the Overheat TM for stronger single-shot damage, allowing it to gain Exp. against random trainers even before evolving. It gets a huge stack of status moves too: Confuse Ray is excellent, Imprison might be useful with very careful planning but isn't generally so, Will-O-Wisp is only shared with the Ghost types it lives nearby. Vulpix learns Grudge at Lv. 37, another "Ghost-type trait" move that I think is severely underrated in in-game playthroughs and makes a small delay of evolution into Ninetales worthwhile, but we can get into that a bit later. Ninetales has decent bulk and great speed, though offensively is just a bit weak thanks to mixed offenses, a severely lacking Normal move + Iron Tail physical movepool, and no special coverage. We just won't talk about its ultimate move Fire Spin, still reeling from its nerf after Gen I. Anyways, with its support moves and these few attacking types though it surely can fill a decent set of four moves and become a solid contributor.

All of this, of course, in spite of all the specific boss fights soon to come. Tate & Liza have the type advantage against Ninetales, though their physical attackers can at least be burned by it. Ninetales can even absorb a Fire type move with Flash Fire, an ability that ends up rather underwhelming for the rest of the game after getting Vulpix. Juan will be tough, Glacia the Ice specialist has a bunch of Water types anyways, and Drake resists many of its attacks. In Ruby and Sapphire it can be a decent Skarmory and Metagross killer against Steven, though it draws dead against Wallace in Emerald (Solarbeam is teachable... next gen. Ugh!). But despite all this, Ninetales is still strangely solid? 100 Speed is incredibly high for these games and means that it gets to set the pace of the battle even on bad matchups. Need a burn or confusion? Need to use Overheat to knock out the last third of a healthbar? Or, if it is soon to be taken out, need to easily drain an opponent's PP? Ninetales can do all of these things. Even against Wallace's fearsome Milotic, Grudge can significantly cripple it by draining Surf PP to the point that a teammate with an Ice resist and a way to deal with Toxic can easily sweep. 

Ninetales on paper isn't great, yet it has surprisingly great unit feel for Hoenn's final Fire type option. It was a great pick for the vibes of Mt. Pyre and players with nostalgia for this excellent design will likely be satisfied by using one in these games.
