### Analysis

**TL;DR: Training Nincada is a huge pain, but Ninjask is a very unique Pokemon that is fun to use.**

The Nincada line is one of the most complex introduced in Generation III of Pokemon. We will cover Shedinja in a later post since it fundamentally plays differently than Ninjask, the subject of this analysis. Nincada is the first Bug/Ground type Pokemon in the series. Its Compoundeyes ability can only be found on Nincada in Hoenn. With 90 Def as well, Nincada stands out for some of its unique qualities early on. If the player chooses to use one though, the early game struggles begin to show quickly.

First and foremost, Nincada is one of few Pokemon in the "Erratic" experience group. This group has the lowest total Exp. at Lv. 100 among the groups... but during the levels in which the player actually plays through these games (5-55 or so), this group requires the most Exp. It is at its worst proportionally at lower levels, precisely when Nincada is at its weakest and needs the most help. Frankly, training Nincada and getting so little Exp. feels pretty terrible, plus using Nincada at this point means stretching the relatively small pool of early game Exp. thin in exchange for contributions from a team member without much kill power, even in the very early game. Indeed: Nincada's moveset forces it to use Scratch or cripple its moveset until Lilycove City with HM Cut for maximum damage. Leech Life and Harden will help its durability, so it is at least able to win against many of the early game trainers... eventually. This set requires spending a lot of turns in exchange for meager Exp. thanks to being Erratic, a pretty rough exchange. Fury Swipes at Lv. 14 is actually nice to have thanks to Compoundeyes, turning the inaccurate move and sidegrade to Scratch at best into a reliable multi-hit option that beats Scratch in terms of damage a majority of the time, but it doesn't make Nincada much easier to train. Thanks to its decent physical bulk, against Roxanne and Brawly it can use Sand-Attack to debuff, but probably cannot contribute many knockouts.

Assuming the player has been feeding Nincada tons and tons of Exp, it finally is able to evolve sometime around when the player reaches Mauville City. Some might consider delaying the evolution so its Electric immunity does not become an Electric weakness for fighting Wattson, but frankly unevolved Nincada will not be able to contribute much anyways (delaying evolution further allows the player to keep the Bug/Ground typing and Compoundeyes, allowing perfect accuracy Fury Cutter & Toxic, plus False Swipe, Metal Claw and no-TM-needed Dig: considering its 266 BST, this is very much not worth it). Upon evolution, Ninjask learns Double Team, Screech, and Fury Cutter; it's worth throwing away most of the old moveset. Ninjask also throws away its old stat line - it literally _loses_ half of its base defense but gains a respectable amount of attack, some special bulk, and so much speed that it becomes the fastest Pokemon in all of Hoenn! Compoundeyes will be missed, as Speed Boost will passively raises Speed every turn, a redundant effect for Ninjask (that at least does have some utility that we'll get into later). For sure, Nincada completely throws away its old identity upon evolution into Ninjask!

Double Team is gimmicky and potentially costly, while Fury Swipes and Fury Cutter are a bit too weak to be reliable damage for Ninjask. Lv. 25's Swords Dance on top of the Dig and Secret Power TMs mean that Ninjask is ready to party (Slash at Lv. 31 works as well). It's highest damage without major drawbacks will come from Return, obtainable after Mt. Chimney. Despite being somewhat frail, Ninjask generally is able to find the time to set up at least one Swords Dance, leading to sweep after sweep against random trainers. As long as it doesn't take an Overheat to the face, it is able to sweep Flannery's team with Swords Dance and Dig; type disadvantage upsets are always enjoyable. Around this time, the Exp. needed by Erratic is still higher than average but trending towards it, meaning with every level Ninjask feels better to train. While not free sweeps, Ninjask should be able to contribute heavy damage against Norman and even Winona as long as it can live an attack or two! 

The final tools for its offensive capabilities are available here: TM Aerial Ace is a great choice for Ninjask, especially as it doesn't learn Fly, and works well alongside Swords Dance, Dig, TM Shadow Ball, and Return for damage as the endgame approaches. A Ninjask trainer probably will feel the best about Ninjask in the midgame, as towards the endgame opponents are going to be more frequently able to knock out Ninjask quickly and/or live +2 boosted attacks. Just as it falls off somewhat as a straightforward offensive contributor, at Lv. 45 Ninjask learns Baton Pass! Ninjask is arguably the best user of Baton Pass in Hoenn, able to pass: automatically gained Speed, Swords Dance boosts, Double Team evasion, or even a Substitute in Emerald. Now Ninjask can set up, get as many knockouts as it can before it faints, then simply pass those boosts to a full health teammate to continue the sweep! Despite type disadvantages against most of the Elite Four and Champions, Ninjask's renewed purpose through Baton Pass make it feel incredible all the way through the end of the game.

Most Bug type Pokemon, especially in the early generations, are designed to come online quickly and fall off as the game goes on. Nincada's exp group, stats, and movepool make it unable to come online for a long time. When it does though, Ninjask comes online and continually gains tools across the game that allowing it to sweep most of the game and help its teammates sweep for the rest. Although it is a shame (like Surskit) that the unique typing Bug/Ground is lost upon evolution in favor of the ubiquitous Bug/Flying, Ninjask plays so differently from others of this type. Ninjask's full training arc isn't all smooth but it feels great to use after all is said and done.
