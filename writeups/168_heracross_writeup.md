### Analysis

**TL;DR: Heracross is a somewhat versatile and solid, late-game Safari Zone pick.**

The non-fossil bug types introduced in this generation all either peak early, are based on gimmicks, or don't peak at all (sorry Masquerain), so including Heracross and Pinsir as the "ultimate" bug type options late in the game and hidden behind Bike Checks makes sense. Heracross is one of the strongest single-stage Pokemon in the first few generations - 125 Atk with a competent physical movepool on top of other decent stats like Speed and Special Defense is a recipe for success. There aren't too many Flying or Fire type moves left in the game after the Safari Zone either, so Heracross has the potential to be a solid contributor in most fights. It has the solid, normally TM-locked and here STAB-boosted Brick Break at base, which allows it to instantly become a contributor and route cleaner. It has an admittedly poor matchup against the Psychic gym twins in part thanks to its only Bug option being Fury Cutter at this point, but against Juan and the Elite Four at large it can generally succeed.

There are a few ways to play Heracross that give it some versatility. One comes in the combination of Endure and Reversal, a moveset that can allow one ideally with a +Speed nature to completely tear late-game opponents apart. Dig and later Earthquake can provide coverage where Fighting moves do not, and Megahorn comes at Lv. 53, which may be just enough time for it to see some use in the late Elite Four depending on how thorough a player is with getting Experience and Rare Candies throughout the game. Megahorn damage can be further augmented with the ability Swarm, which has good synergy with Endure as well. Alternatively, it is one of the few Pokemon with access to Guts - paired with a status condition this means that it can absolutely decimate with Facade, though this is a bit of a pain to actually do. Players looking for a bit more oomph on their team in the late game have Heracross as an option and can go multiple directions with it!
