### Analysis

**Verdict: Blaziken is a decent "medium difficulty" starter, though Hoenn's plentiful water may make its endgame frustrating.**

In the years since Generation III, Blaziken has become notorious for its Uber-level competitive performance, but that's largely thanks to its Mega Evolution and Speed Boost ability, added later. With only 80 Base speed, Blaziken isn't quite the speedy powerhouse in this game that its later performances might imply; on top of a typing that doesn't do it too many favors especially in Emerald, the Torchic line adds less to a smooth run than the Mudkip line overall. At the same time, Combusken has a much better midgame than Grovyle thanks to an actual offensive moveset, so ultimately this line settles in to being the "medium difficulty" starter for RSE. 

In a lot of ways the very early game of Hoenn matches Kanto: choosing the Fire starter means an early type advantage in the forest full of bugs (and against Seedot and Shroomish), but a type disadvantage against the first gym's Rock types. Each starter choice makes this section play out differently, but either way the player will be forced to learn about type matchups. With far more team options than Kanto to dispense with Rock types, though, Torchic players will probably end up with an easier time against Roxanne than Charmander users against Brock. For the sake of interesting discussion, I assume in this series that the player isn't surpassing the next gym leader's highest level, but I will bring up Torchic's evolution here. Staying at the Lv. 15 cap means Growl, Scratch/Cut, Ember, and Focus Energy on top of Torchic's pure Fire typing and lesser stats mean of course that it is relegated to Attack debuffing, hoping for burns, and praying for bad AI and/or Rock Tomb dodges. Especially for a new player there is a high chance that their Torchic has hogged most of the experience - allowing it to evolve to Combusken, gaining the Fighting type to neutralize Rock, and learning the super-effective Double Kick. Players wishing to challenge themselves against this gym have the option of keeping unevolved Torchic while new players have an easy answer after a bit of grinding, so that is a neat bit of game design.

All Hoenn starters have a few exclusive moves if unevolved: Torchic's are Fire Spin at Lv. 25 and Flamethrower at Lv. 43. Neither of these are worth giving up on Combusken's typing, Double Kick, and superior stats... but it is an option. Peck at Lv. 16 will have less base power against most if not all opponents compared to STAB Ember and Double Kick, but it's flavor for the chicken line, I guess. That said, Double Kick plus Focus Energy is a really solid combo of moves that will allow Combusken with its 85 Attack a lot of success in the midgame! Brawly's Bulk Up can be countered with a well-timed critical hit, and increased chances for two is the best you can get for this part of the game. With one of many Grass-type options available at this point to handle Marshtomp (and even Combusken's Sand-Attack as a last ditch debuff effort), the Rival fight on Route 110 isn't usually too threatening. Alongside the Bulk Up TM as a reliable staple from here on, it can take out Wattson's Magneton, though it usually gets outsped and worn down by Manectric. TM Dig is the perfect tool on top of Bulk Up and the Fire typing against Flannery - it can usually survive an Overheat or two and pull off a sweep! It does get a shoutout for its performance against Norman of course - being able to bulk up Physical stats, hit hard with super effective Double Kick, and even fire off an Overheat if necessary make it the best starter in the fight. Still, the Mudkip line outperforms it against at least three of the first five gyms (Brawly debatable) while the Treecko line is pretty objectively worse against all but Roxanne of the five, so Combusken further cements its spot in the middle of the pack.

Heading towards the lategame, Combusken does struggle a little bit on its own against Winona and in the rains of the jungle, but by now the player should have solid team support and Combusken should still be able to reach evolution without too much struggle. Here it finally gets some solid options to make use of its 110 SpA and Fire typing: Blaze Kick is a fun signature move with its 85 BP and chance to burn. At least it isn't _completely_ outclassed like Muddy Water: Fire Punch is a tradeoff of less power and a Heart Scale for more accuracy, while Flamethrower can be purchased or grinded for at the Game Corner. Overheat can also be used long-term: using primarily Physical moves and Bulk Up with Overheat as a change-up option for tricky threats is effective. TM Return's 102 BP, or STAB Double Kick's 90 remain its highest physical damage options (discounting gimmick moves Focus Punch and DynamicPunch), notably leading it to at least beat out a majority of the wimpy Water types on the trainers in Hoenn's ocean. Very late in the game, only in Sootopolis City will the Brick Break TM become available, helping it at least barely pass 110 BP with STAB and hit Pokemon like Walrein super effectively, at least. Sky Uppercut has a bit more damage and a bit less accuracy, but comes too late unless the player delayed Combusken's evolution. It can learn Earthquake as well, though it doesn't cover as many holes for Blaziken as it does for other Pokemon. This ultimately leaves a few options for full movesets going in to the endgame: usually it wants 1 or 2 of Blaze Kick/Flamethrower/Overheat/Fire Punch, 1 or 2 of Focus Punch/Double Kick/Brick Break, maybe a coverage move like Earthquake/Return, and a potential few slots for utility moves: Bulk Up/Focus Energy/Mirror Move (why not?)/Rest/Substitute.

A player familiar with the final few gym leaders and Elite Four in Hoenn will be able to see why Blaziken doesn't perform quite as well in the endgame as the player would hope. Its 80 Speed is just low enough that it loses speed matchups against the higher leveled Pokemon of the later Elite Four, and its 80/70/70 defenses just aren't enough to help it survive strong super effective attacks. It's not suited particularly well for Double battles or the Rock/Ground/Flying + Psychic types that make up Tate & Liza's team, and it has a hard time pulling off a sweep against the Water leader. It gets a few freebies in Sidney and Phoebe in the Elite Four, but those are freebies for most teams at this point in the game... if it gets a turn or two to set up, it can sweep Glacia, but that's about where the 'fun' ends for Blaziken in Emerald. In Ruby and Sapphire at least Blaziken can contribute successfully against Skarmory, Cradily, and even Metagross (it'll be close to a speed tie). But the last two fights in Emerald really suck for the guy: Drake's Dragon types past Shelgon all have a super effective move against Blaziken, whose moveset is severely lacking here. Just to add insult to injury, Wallace is yet another Water type boss that can OHKO a Lv. 50-53 Blaziken in one shot with all of his Pokemon.

Ultimately, this is why I think promoting Wallace to the champion over Steven is one of the biggest blunders that Pokemon Emerald made from a gameplay perspective: making the player's first and quite possibly most beloved partner just fall on its ass almost always isn't the best decision in the world. Sceptile fans may eat here, but Blaziken gets dunked on and becomes so utterly useless in the Wallace fight that it's discouraging, really. Not that I think Speed Boost or the Blazikenite should be the solutions here, but I think a little bit more touching up the final trainers specifically for the Blaziken-heads in the Emerald crowd could have been a nice touch. It's really a minor digression all things considered, since the Torchic line still is able to be pretty solid throughout the early-to-mid game. It's a solid starter with a good dual typing that makes use of a couple less common TMs well and can fit in well as a team member with most of Hoenn's denizens, and those who use it will probably not be _too_ disappointed in it when looking back on their whole journey through Hoenn. Probably.
