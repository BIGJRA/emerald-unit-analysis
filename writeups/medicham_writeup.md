### Analysis

**Verdict: An interesting ability and moveset allow mid-to-late game unit Medicham to be a fun, unique team option.**

The first exposure the player will have to Meditite is seeing it in Brawly's gym, where it can potentially destroy an unsuspecting player with Focus Punch. Although Makuhita is available near Dewford if the player is interested in getting one, a player first obtain six badges to get one. Even then, is subject to Pokemon's original sin: version exclusivity, in this case extra annoying since it is absent from the more polished and complete Emerald version. Despite this, I think Medicham has interesting unit design in Hoenn as a fun late game team addition in Ruby and Sapphire. Let's get into it!

One interesting thing about Meditite is that it has the power level befitting a gym 2 enemy, yet is acquired late enough and has an evolution level high enough that you can't just skip the pre-evolution phase of using it, meaning it has pretty bad stats to start off with. When you get Meditite, it comes with a fairly odd moveset: Confusion or Calm Mind, Detect, Hidden Power, and Mind Reader. Calm Mind is generally a good move and avoiding needing to use the one-of-a-kind TM is generally a boon. Psychic is a great Special STAB type, but with 60 SpA, even one or two uses of Calm Mind aren't likely to propel it to easy sweeping potential. Meditite does have other set up options aside from Calm Mind: it can relearn Meditate for a Heart Scale, or, if it hasn't been used yet, it can learn the superior TM Bulk Up. Again though, a physical set would seem to have similar issues scaling off of 60 Atk.

 Of course, that isn't the whole story due to Pure Power - essentially doubling Atk! Just a few levels after having to slum it on Hidden Power, Confusion, maybe Strength and Meditite learns it's signature-in-Hoenn move Hi Jump Kick - a very gimmicky move but that will suddenly turn Medicham into an OHKO machine, especially after boosting Atk. Yet Hi Jump Kick has 90% accuracy and will just dump its damage onto Medicham instead if it misses. Suddenly the bizarre move Mind Reader makes more sense from a design perspective, but the idea of using an extra moveslot just to turn uses of Hi Jump Kick into two-turn affairs for reliability is just not practical. 
 
Putting that aside, it can abuse Pure Power with other physical options like Focus Punch and Shadow Ball to really start rolling. With its set up moves, now including TMs like Light Screen, Protect, Reflect, 280 BST Meditite has an extremely flexible moveset, able to set up four different stats, screens, hit hard with Pure Power... it's a whole lot that makes Meditite play like no other Pokemon at this point in the game. Using Medicham long term does require having it fight a lot of trainers in this section: Mt. Pyre trainers aren't particularly kind to it, but it can get rolling on Route 123 or just by using the Exp. Share. 

Putting up with its low stat, good ability/moveset split soon leads to an evolution into Medicham, whose stats do increase enough that its bulk and raw kill power go up enough for it to become a full fletched contributor going forward. Those inclined for special Medicham can take advantage of its Level 1 moves: Medicham is the only Pokemon in Hoenn that gets all three elemental punches as relearner moves, for some reason. Thunderpunch isn't fantastic or anything, but it may be an option for the water-centric late game. The only other standout change physically to Medicham going forward is TM Brick Break, which sacrifices the flavor and a bit of power of Hi Jump Kick in favor of reliability. The Brick Break TM coming so late and the gimmicky nature of Focus Punch do at least give Hi Jump Kick some time to shine in Medicham's moveset, but 85 base Power isn't enough to justify the massive drawback of this move in comparison past that. Reversal is also a late game option (no Endure here, however), while TM Psychic also becomes an option right at the end - workable with Calm Mind, but not incredible or anything.

TM Shadow Ball makes it kind of a one-or-two-use nuke against Tate & Liza, while its raw power with Brick Break can help it shatter Wallace. These two moves line up really well against the first three Elite Four members, and can take half of Champion Steven's team on well too. It's raw physical power is the best way to use it in all of these fights, but Calm Mind, Thunderpunch, Ice Punch, and Psychic can round out a special moveset if one is really inclined. Even on the fights where it won't sweep, screens are always appreciated - it has just enough bulk and speed to set them even in disadvantageous matchups. 

Many ways to run Medicham allow it to contribute to any player's team that chooses to add it so late into the game. Though not the simplest unit in the game, Medicham is very fun to use.
