### Analysis

**Verdict: Torkoal is cool and feels unique, even if the late game is mean to him >:(**

Torkoal has 470 BST and is obtainable very early into the game - with about 10 easy-to-get levels, it can catch up to the rest of the player's team just in time to face off against Flannery's ace, also a Torkoal. As far as Fire type options in Hoenn go, Torkoal is among the first non-Torchic options in the game, and is the fastest to get up to speed thanks to not needing to evolve. Torkoal has only 20 Base Speed: almost always going second is a drawback, but Torkoal has other attributes that make up for it. The Macho Brace's speed penalty means nothing, so this means free EVs to help it catch up in other areas, for one. Past the 20 Speed, the other 450 stat points are allocated to its other stats: 70/140/70 defenses are pretty incredible, while 85/85 offenses allow Torkoal to function as a mixed attacker. In a game where Fire isn't the best offensive type, having strong physical options as a backup is going to be valuable to get a bit more mileage out of Torkoal. White Smoke is also a very interesting ability, as it turns out disabling enemy stat drops altogether makes a game full of Intimidate, Screech, Smokescreen, etc. pretty satisfying!

It gets moves by leveling up that make using it simple: Ember (Lv. 1) and Smog (4) work as offensive moves that get it off the ground to start. Body Slam (20) is an excellent physical move with a good secondary effect of paralysis, Curse (7) allows it to set up on nearly any physical-based opponent, and Flamethrower (30) allows it to use the powerful no-drawback STAB move without having to spend $80000 on the TM at the Game Corner. Down the line it even gets both Iron Defense (33) and Amnesia (40) just in case a player wanted to buff both of its defensive stats to insane levels, after which it might as well use Fire Spin (17) to wear down opponents ignoring offenses otherwise. It can use Flail (43) for huge damage at low HP, it can spam Smokescreen (14) as a supporter against unfavorable bosses, or take advantage of Protect (27) and Heat Wave (46) in Doubles. Though I am exaggerating the true use case of some of these moves, in a generation that likes to make tons of one-stage Pokemon have pretty poor level-up movepools, Torkoal's is solid. On top of all this, it gets useful TMs/tutors like Sludge Bomb, Return, Explosion, and Iron Tail as niche options for Curse sets and Rest and Substitute for rounding out defensive sets. 

All of this seems pretty good on paper, though unfortunately Torkoal has dramatically diminishing returns as the game goes on. It is sometimes able to defeat Flannery and Norman alone with some Curse sweeping and is a good choice for Winona's Skarmory and Tropius, of course. Yet entering Hoenn's ocean full of Water trainers mean that its low speed becomes a massive liability: training Torkoal isn't a simple proposition anymore. It's frankly bad against Tate & Liza as well as Juan/Wallace. It can do ok against the weaker members of the Elite Four, but Glacia's Water coverage and Drake's Kingdra/Flygon/Salamence trio make getting lots out of Torkoal difficult. Emerald's Champion Wallace pretty much always OHKO's it with his entire team... but Ruby and Sapphire's Champion Steven at least has a few Pokemon weak to Torkoal that give it a fairer shake!

Torkoal is a cool Pokemon - though low speed isn't great, it has the tools that it needs to be usable regardless. Yet an onslaught of disadvantageous trainer fights towards the end of the game are meaner to Torkoal than they need to be, so trainers will end up either loving or hating this design as a result. I like him though >:)
