### Analysis

**TL;DR: The Gardevoir line has great unit feel as a growth unit. Duh!**

Take a gander at a Hall of Fame post by someone who has just completed a run through one of the Hoenn games, and there is a good chance that you'll see a Gardevoir. In many ways the Gardevoir line feels great to use: it has near-perfect availability, it is just rare enough that it feels rewarding while not being frustrating, it has two evolutions that help you feel its growth through gameplay, and its typing overlaps with none of the starters or any other Pokemon in the first section of the game (until Emerald with Abra). The friendly rival Wally catches one, fitting _his_ character growth arc for one (with the side-effect of making the new player aware of its existence). All of that comes before Gardevoir's viability as a unit in-and-of-itself: great stats, amazing movepool, and even _multiple_ ways to set up. It has two useful but different abilities, making it yet more versatile. Its popularity in Hoenn teams is evident - there's a lot to like about this unit!

In the beginning... there was only Growl. Indeed Ralts comes with only a status move that isn't even particularly useful on it, showcasing its initial issues, but hopefully hinting at its potential as a growth unit. Its stats contribute significantly to this feeling as Ralts is actually the sixth worst Pokemon by Base Stat Total in Gen III (and tenth-worst today). The Ralts user ought not fret however as it gets STAB Confusion in only two levels, allowing it to start dealing real damage and gain levels easily. Double Team, the first of its setup options, comes in at Lv. 11 and allows for some fun evasion gaming even if Ralts' defensive stats don't back it up without a lot of luck. Ralts is not likely to be able to solo Roxanne (without insane Double Team luck) thanks to Nosepass's heavy hitting attacks and decent SpD, but the aforementioned Growl and Confusion can still allow it to contribute well enough. Immediately after this is Brawly's gym; Ralts will still be unevolved but its type advantage allows it to contribute well despite this. Hoenn's early game is decent to Ralts despite its statistical shortcomings.

The evolution to Kirlia is an interesting one because... it doesn't really make it much better. Kirlia gains only 80 base stat points total, bringing it to 49th place BST among the 386 Gen III Pokemon. _It's worse than Unown!_ Despite all this though Kirlia still gets tools that make it viable during the midgame: Lv. 21 Calm Mind, Lv. 26's Psychic, and the TM for Shock Wave basically make a complete, viable set for Kirlia... faster than basically every other Pokemon in the game. It's not the best Pokemon against Wattson nor Flannery yet isn't dead weight.

Right before the player fights their father who helped Wally obtain his Ralts, Kirlia can evolve into Gardevoir. And then it's _really_ online. The aforementioned moveset combined with 125 SpA, 80 Speed, and decent defensive stats help this Pokemon become a top-tier playthrough choice from this point onwards. For each remaining boss fight: at worst, it will be able to score a KO or two, at best it will sweep! The player need not touch its moveset from here, but there are still tons of new toys that can be useful. Offensively, The Thunderbolt TM (upgraded Shock Wave), helps it sweep Winona, deal with Dark types, and zap the late-game Water types, while Shadow Ball is a physical option for other Psychic types if needed. It gets all the hits of Psychic type status moves too: Reflect, Light Screen, Skill Swap, even Imprison. Hypnosis and Dream Eater is a wicked and unique combo too for RSE Pokemon, though it comes way too late to be actually useful in a playthrough (unless the player Exp. Share trains an unevolved Ralts, at least).

Worth discussing is what its two abilities add to gameplay. Synchronize is the less interesting of the two, being shared with Alakazam and Xatu, but is a fun "big brain" ability when it works. On the other hand, Gardevoir gets Trace all to itself in Hoenn. Trace is quite the fun ability to plan around - copying the ability of whatever it is sent out upon allows for tons and tons of interesting interactions. Gardevoir doesn't care about Atk drops but an Intimidate users would? Use Trace on Intimidate! Trying to deal with Juan and Wallace's Swift Swim under rain? Copy it! It is often not contributing anything, but copying different things each battle is part of the fun! If only there was an enemy trainer in game with a Shedinja...

The Gardevoir line has a rocky start with terrible stats as Ralts and Kirlia, yet one of the best level up plus TM learnsets in the game and high end-game stats allow it to function as the ultimate growth unit.
