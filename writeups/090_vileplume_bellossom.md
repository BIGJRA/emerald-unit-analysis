### Analysis

**Verdict: The Oddish line is fairly by-the-books for a Grass-type archetype, but at least the evolution choice is interesting this time.**

The Oddish line is a bit of a strange one: first it was a simple level-stone three-stage evolution line in Gen. I. Next comes a branching evolution from Gloom, Bellossom, introduced in Gen. II. Unless the player is really dedicated to waiting for a call from one NPC to get a Leaf Stone in Crystal only though, actually using Vileplume in this game is a huge pain - for all intents and purposes Oddish/Gloom/Bellossom is the reasonably reached evolution path for Johto. In some ways, this line's inclusion is incredibly redundant. Chlorophyll is an already-distributed ability over the Hoenn region's new grass types like Shiftry and Tropius. The more defensive status-spreading Grass/Poison archetype is already filled by the new Roselia. Yet the Gen. III games chose this line to fill four of its coveted "returnee" Pokedex slots... so as always, it is worth asking: why?

From a story perspective, the idea of the "Weed Pokemon" fits _perfectly_ with the idea of Route 110: the Cycling Road above contrasted with the untidy grassy path beneath. While this line isn't necessarily more interesting or unique than Hoenn's new grass types, for the "Weed Pokemon" to just kinda _be there_ makes a lot of narrative sense regardless. The other reason I speculate this line was included is fairly simple: you get to actually choose which evolution path to go down here... the player can choose whether they like the sunny, more offense-oriented Bellossom or the gloomy, defense-oriented Vileplume. Hoenn's story is a lot about the interplay between our choices and nature, so this line does play into that theme well enough.

As far as gameplay goes, Oddish and its nearby evolution Gloom are extremely weak attackers but have a lot of versatility in terms of status moves, learning Stun Spore, Sleep Powder, and Poison Powder via leveling up and even Swagger by tutor and Attract by TM. Being able to use these status moves and resist Electric does give Gloom a bit of a niche against Wattson, at least. Gloom's 65 Attack and 85 Special Attack are high enough to be able to battle using Bullet Seed, Acid, and Secret Power... but it's weak, so status moves remain its best contribution against the rest of the midgame bosses like Flannery and Norman. 

Both evolutions will cut off the ability to relearn Sleep Powder and Poison Powder, though the latter is easily replaced by Toxic if need be, so the player must decides which status moves are most important going forward. The first potential for its evolution can occur as soon as Meteor Falls if the player wishes, but only in Ruby and Emerald, all thanks to Solrock's potential to hold a Sun Stone. The evolution into Vileplume requires a Leaf Stone, available a bit later on Route 119. In Sapphire, the earliest Sun Stone can be obtained in Mossdeep City, a point at which Gloom will be struggling hard except against the weakest ocean trainers. Moonlight at Lv. 35 is the only reason to consider delaying either evolution - a great healing move that synergizes well with Chlorophyll under the sun, though Vileplume and Bellossom can function fine without it. 

In either case, going into the late game an Oddish user will now have an evolved Grass type, with or without the Poison type, and with notably high Special stats and low Speed. Both will prefer having the sun out to function and can learn Sunny Day to get it there, and are good picks for TM Solarbeam, though Bellossom only learns it very late at Lv. 55 if the player wants to save the TM. Especially in Emerald with the Water-type champion Wallace, both Pokemon are going to be solid picks for offense with this set, and can at minimum be status-bots for the rest of the Elite Four.

# VILEPLUME TODO

Just to look at Bellossom specifically: it is slightly more statistically inclined towards defense, though it has one more weakness than Vileplume. That said, its lack of Psychic weakness gives it a bit more survivability against the Tate & Liza fights, while its two new weaknesses in Bug and Poison are fairly uncommon in the lategame. It gets Magical Leaf as a relearner move, which can help an early-evolution Bellossom sweep the Sand Veil critters of the desert or get guaranteed damage against Juan's Kingdra, I suppose.

While they're not too much different from each other, at least the split evolution presents an interesting choice. Both Pokemon are able to transition from weak status-spreaders to Sun-based utility and high super-effective damage dealers in Hoenn's lategame. The Oddish line feels decent to use in Hoenn all things considered.
