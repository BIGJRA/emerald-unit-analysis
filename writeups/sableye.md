### Analysis

**Verdict: ~~Like Vander from Fire Emblem Engage~~, Sableye is great only very early but can do some utility in the late game for its fans.**

Sableye was a complete surprise for me, despite playing Gen. III a lot as a kid, I had never touched Sableye until recently. It has a very fun typing in Dark/Ghost which simply has no weaknesses, which helps cover up the middling 50/75/65 defensive stats it has.  With it's somewhat high stats for this point in the game compared to the NFE Pokemon that surround it, Sableye is a textbook pick for players that feel they are struggling in the early game yet maybe aren't looking for a unit that can experience a lot of growth. Aside from its generally appealing art design, let's explore why Sableye is generally beloved and such a fun pick for Sapphire and especially Emerald.

Brawly is one of the tougher gym leaders in Gen. III due to the combination of Makuhita's bulk and set-up move in an early game without a ton of great tools. A player struggling with him might go train in Granite Cave, where they might run into this curious critter in the depths. Due to its relatively low catch rate for the early game, it feels extra rewarding to get one. Due to its typing, the player is in for the surprise of learning how absolutely stacked Sableye is against the Dewford Gym. _Emerald Brawly literally cannot damage Sableye_ (in RS only a pathetic Knock Off can deal damage), while Sableye can use Night Shade for a simple win. If a player drops Sableye from their team afterwards, the tale was still told of the little cave gremlin solution to the Knuckle Badge problem.

Regardless, it is still worth analyzing Sableye going forward. Now that we have to consider it outside the context of the Brawly sweep, there are some things to note. It isn't very fast hence is generally a good Quick Claw user. It's Atk (and Ghost STAB) is slightly stronger than its SpA (and Dark STAB), though Night Shade can fill in for flat damage for as long as the player wants it. It tends to ping pong back and forth from its strongest STAB being a Ghost or Dark type move, which have generally have similar use cases anyway, so it doesn't need to use up too many moveslots on simple damage moves. In the remaining moveslots can fit a remarkably wide support movepool, allowing it to fill many team roles but that require a lot more mechanical knowledge than the average click-STAB-and-win Pokemon.

Swagger (E), Fake Out, and the generally available Torment TM are good choices. The latter can make for some very interesting battles thanks to limited early game enemy movesets plus its three immunities. Detect at Lv. 25 furthers this effect. Metronome and Mimic are also funny options to fill moveslots if the player wants. Faint Attack takes over as the best attacking move for a little while, useful against Double Team spammers and Sandshrew in the desert, but never doing a ton of damage. Sableye won't be the star of the show in any major fights during this period, but it is good at crippling threats to the rest of one's team.

It has one more moment to really shine: vs. Norman, a generally tough fight. Detect (especially with PP Ups) is a simple way to deal with the Slakings, and only takes direct damage from weak Faint Attacks otherwise. While this might be another good moment for a player to consider dropping Sableye as its stats become unable to keep up, there are still things it can do in the mid-to-late game. More utility options open up like Toxic, Taunt, Substitute (E), Rain Dance for some reason, and Confuse Ray. Shadow Ball, by TM or later level up, is its best damage option in general, though it also makes reasonable use of Focus Punch on top of all its utility and phasing moves. It gets Rest and Calm Mind by TM late into the game though, so there may be a very niche set taking advantage of those things if a player is dedicated and lucky enough to avoid crits. 

There isn't a ton to say about Sableye in the end game fights, however. It is maybe useful against Tate & Liza for its doubles utility and super effective Shadow Balls. While it can use a ton of TMs and tutor moves, there isn't some silver bullet set that solves the Elite Four or anything like that. Though not a game-changing achievement, it can at least help out against Phoebe? Anyway, Sableye's shining moments may pass long before the endgame, but it is still a Pokemon that is willing to pay dividends immediately for catching it and remain a useful party member for the knowledgeable player.
