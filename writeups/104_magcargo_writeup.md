### Analysis

**TL;DR: Magcargo is such a disappointment... But at least it is in the game this time.**

I'm not the first to point out that Magcargo is absolutely awful as a unit. An extremely late evolution at Lv. 38 to only end up with 410 BST, exactly one good stat in Defense that isn't even backed up with a good HP stat, and a typing that gets completely flattened by two common attacking types in Water and Ground. All of these sins originated with the Slugma line in Gen. II however - I'll leave asking what the purpose of this line is in _those_ games to others. We're here to look at how Slugma feels as a unit in Gen. III and what the designers might have intended when putting it in this game. 

Despite how bad Slugma is as a unit, I will actually defend its inclusion here. By being only available on three routes of Kanto in Gen. II, the line might as well not exist - every single other Fire type in the game is available long before it... but in Hoenn, Slugma is one of the few available Fire types early in the game (with Torkoal and Numel) when discounting Torchic. Three fire types in the Fiery Path and surrounding areas is a reasonable count, and Slugma fits in well here. Slugma is actually playable in the main game of Hoenn, so this might as well be its first potential venture for players at this point in Pokemon. Not to pretend that Camerupt and Torkoal are on the same level as Magcargo... but it's at least an option and isn't completely dead weight the entire game or anything!

Slugma's 20 Speed means it is going to take a lot of attacks from the time you obtain it, and its 40/40/40 defensive spread means it won't live too many of them, either. 70 SpA is a decent attacking stat at the moment, though looking into its moveset we see one problem emerge: it has NO special attacking types aside from Fire. Attacking with Slugma and doing any real damage means using Fire type moves, then... Rock Throw (no STAB yet) and Smog will do pitiful damage. It has Yawn at least - a reliable Sleep move that can help the rest of a team gain momentum. To some degree Yawn has anti-synergy with one of its abilities: Flame Body. The Slugma line is the only choice for this ability in Hoenn, so it has that going for it. There are a lot of direct attackers in this game though: Flame Body will activate frequently, allowing Slugma a bit more survivability and chip damage against opponents! Its other ability is Magma Armor, which prevents the least common status condition, Freeze. Might as well go with Flame Body for the dopamine when it triggers!

So Slugma is a Pokemon that will only be able to deal damage with Fire moves for the most part, but has Yawn for support. The best news that Hoenn has for this Pokemon comes in the fourth Gym TM: Overheat is excellent on this line, at least. Overheat is real damage that has the potential to OHKO enemy Pokemon once in a while! It's level-up moveset won't be doing it many favors during its growth arc: Harden and Amnesia seem to imply Magcargo should do a defensive set-up build... but considering its weaknesses and lack of any healing options until Rest, it really isn't going to work. As its stats fall off, Overheat, Yawn, maybe the Exp. Share, and a lot of TLC will carry Slugma to Lv. 36 where it learns the no-drawback Flamethrower, at least. Two more levels and it _finally_ evolves into Magcargo. If Slugma was at best a support mon with the capacity to nuke one or two Pokemon, lets see how Magcargo fairs.

Statwise at least, it gains a significant amount of SpD and especially Def, with a bit more HP and SpA to help it out. Frankly, Magcargo's Rock typing will do it 0 favors from here on out. If the player still has their Rock Tomb TM, they can use that to do negligible damage and get a speed drop, at least? Magcargo has the honor of being one of a small number of Rock Slide learners, though its low speed and low attack make this a pretty bad choice regardless of STAB. What's left is an extra weakness to Water, Ground, and Fighting... not a great trade.

All that said, around the time Magcargo evolves, you can get department store TMs. I'm not totally sure why they did this, but thank Arceus they did: Magcargo can learn both Reflect and Light Screen. While Harden and Amnesia are wasted if Magcargo faints, the screens aren't: the most dedicated of Magcargo users now have a use for their snails even in the late game fights... though Wallace will probably OHKO it with every single Pokemon. Anyways, Overheat/Yawn/Light Screen/Reflect is just helpful enough of a set that Magcargo doesn't end up completely dead weight despite all its shortcomings. It's bad, but bad with a smile as it is allowed to shine a tiny bit in Hoenn!
