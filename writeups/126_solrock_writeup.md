### Analysis

**TL;DR: Average, but fitting ludonarratively for Hoenn at least.**

Solrock is part of a version exclusive pair with Lunatone - Solrock is a magical rock that resembles the Sun, fitting for the game containing Groudon, though at seemingly random Solrock alone is chosen to be available in Emerald. One thing to note is its non-party usage; it can hold Sun Stones, allowing the player to evolve Gloom into Bellossom early! Otherwise, Solrock fits in with other Pokemon like Zangoose/Seviper, Torkoal, etc. as being single-stage options in the midgame, lower-level than the players team yet able to come online quickly. Lets get into how using Solrock feels in Ruby and Emerald.

Solrock's stats lean towards the physical as compared to Lunatone: 95 Atk and 85 Def are its highest stats. The rest are fairly middling: 55 SpA mean its Psychic STABs and special coverage moves won't hit very hard... sure hope there aren't a ton of those in its movepool. With 70 HP, 65 SpD, and 70 Speed, it has just the recipe to get outsped and oneshotted by super effective Water moves - hope there aren't a ton of those in the endgame. Levitate is appreciated thanks to its weakness to Ground, though with SIX OTHER weaknesses, its defensive typing still leaves a lot to be desired. Solrock basically has the moveset of a Rock-type attacker, a Psychic-type attacker, and a sun-based Fire/Grass type all rolled into one: it starts with Rock Throw/Rock Tomb by TM, Confusion and later Psywave, and Fire Spin. With a type advantage against Flannery it does fairly well in this fight, and is one of few non-Fire types that can take advantage of the Overheat TM! Especially with (thematically fitting) Sunny Day support it can do non-negligible damage with this move in spite of its low SpA.

Going into the midgame, it learns Cosmic Power, though this isn't the best Pokemon for defensive bulking. Still, it can hold its own against Norman and some of Winona's team thanks to its defensive typing, making this part of the game its best. At Lv. 37, Solrock becomes the strongest Rock Slide user in Hoenn - a reasonably nice niche that helps it contribute pretty well in its mirror match against Tate & Liza. To actually deal damage with coverage moves, it really wants the Shadow Ball and/or Earthquake TM - STAB Psychic, Overheat/Fire Blast, and Solarbeam which it fittingly learns by level up will all be far too underpowered going into the late game. The best part of Solrock's Psychic typing is the fact it learns the magical status moves like Light Screen, and Reflect to at least contribute something in fights where it is otherwise outmatched. 

Because there are a lot of fights where it is outmatched. Water Gym Leader? Oof. Dark type Elite Four? Oof. Ghost type Elite Four? Oof. Ice type Elite Four? Has a ton of Water moves. Dragon type Elite Four? Ok, this is where Solrock will shine most, but only really against Altaria and Salamence (if it is switched after Intimidate). 
And of course, Steel or Water type Champion? OOF! Solrock's final level up move, Explosion, might just be its best contribution in the Elite Four gauntlet, allowing it to possibly contribute a cheap knockout per fight. Solrock has a nice midgame after it is obtained but gets pretty destroyed in the late game, so it doesn't feel too good long term. As a result it ends up feeling very... average! But then, it is a Sun-lookalike Pokemon, and it learns Sun-related moves. It is a magical rock, and it learns Psychic and Rock type moves. They chose to let this be the "physical one" of the pair, so it excels only physically. Solrock's design put together makes a ton of sense in the world of Pokemon, so its average gameplay can't completely hold back the feel of using this "Meteorite Pokemon".
