### Analysis

**TL;DR: Tropius feels pretty bad despite being a Grass type obtainable right before Hoenn's ocean...**

Tropius is such a strange Pokemon. It's not an earlier-gen Pokemon plunked out of its earlier context and thrown into Hoenn - it is intentionally designed around its habitat. Yet it just feels like a really strange unit. Its highest stats in order are HP, SpD, and Def, implying it is meant to play a tanky role. Synthesis at Lv. 47, (the ubiquitous) Rest TM, and Giga Drain TMs seem to be the only major tools it has towards being an effective tank. The Grass/Flying typing has five common weaknesses including a quad-weakness to Ice, which doesn't help its case. 51 Speed is just low enough that it will get outsped most of the time, while 68/72 Atk/SpA isn't enough to make its STAB options like Magical Leaf, Aerial Ace, Fly, and Giga Drain hit hard in the late game.

Hoenn has ten Grass-type Pokemon lines in total - four of which have the Chlorophyll ability and access to sun-boosted moves like Solarbeam. The problem is arguably Tropius' typing and odd stat distribution leave it worse off than all three of the others (Vileplume, Bellossom, and Shiftry), and it comes far later into the game than them. The first Leaf Stone or Sun Stone is available around the point that Tropius becomes available too, so any advantages a fully-evolved Tropius would bring to the table end up being unremarkable. Tropius is even caught exclusively on a rainy route too, an interesting piece of world-building that ultimately distracts from its best build in game. At best Tropius is able to set sun, hit moderately hard with Solarbeam, and heal itself up when necessary, but those other Pokemon all end up doing this better than it.

It's not just hypothetical, either; Tropius has a somewhat hard time against the remaining boss fights even when there is a type advantage in its favor. Winona and Drake will notably give Tropius a tough time, but even Tate & Liza's Ground and Rock types can hit back hard and protect themselves with Light Screen. The fights against Juan and Wallace, regardless of game, end up being tough for Tropius because despite its defensive leanings it crumples to Ice Beam. Tropius ends up in a kill-or-be-killed situation against Water types with Ice moves, and without consistent Sun the latter ends up being what happens more frequently. 

Most players end up knowing Tropius for one thing only: its HM potential. Tropius is one of the most appealing options for the newly obtained HM Fly on Route 119 - it also can learn Cut, Flash, Rock Smash, and Strength, making it a match with most Water types to have complete HM coverage in this game! It's hard to say to what extent GameFreak was actively designing units at this point in the franchise around their field move utility, but here it really feels like they thought this justified its pathetic battle potential.

The problem here is in how Tropius ends up not delivering on expectations, really. Players who wisely think as they approach the late game that a Grass type would be a good addition to their rosters might see the last available Grass type and assume it would be a good choice for this role, but it ends up not really being. Giving it more Special Attack or more Speed in favor of one of its three defensive stats might work at changing this reputation a little bit. Or, hear me out, _banana themed signature move_.
