### Analysis

**Verdict: Dusclops is a late-game bulky utility/attacker Pokemon, an unnecessary role but fun to use regardless.**

The only Ghost-type options available to the player are the gimmicky Shedinja and the low-stat early game crutch Sableye (except in Ruby) before reaching Mt. Pyre - where Duskull and Shuppet become available. This pair is "soft" version exclusives - Duskull is available a tad earlier and is more frequently found in Ruby while Shuppet is the same for Sapphire and Emerald, but both are still easily available in all three games. Duskull stands out as more defensive while Shuppet stands out as more offensive: if the player is looking to fill one of their final team slots with a defensive Pokemon with the reasonably good defensive type mono-Ghost, Duskull is a good choice for it. After all, Dusclops is the ace of one of the Elite Four, so it is designed to be solid for a reason!

Duskull's stats overall aren't too impressive right off the bat: though its defenses are high, its HP is ridiculously small and its attacking stats are bad. There is a bit of a growth arc that Duskull needs to undertake thanks to its evolution level still being a bit in the distance, but its encounter level and evolution level feel just right. On the moveset side, it gets Confuse Ray, Disable, and Night Shade, which help it contribute right away. Notably, it can learn the Shadow Ball TM immediately, a good choice that takes advantage of the line's slightly higher physical attack stat. Facade, Ice Beam, or (expensive) Psychic are options if the player really wants more coverage here. There is a long stretch of game right after obtaining Duskull without gym fights: thanks to its moveset, Levitate ability, Ghost typing, and set of trainers in and around the Mt. Pyre area actually allow it to gain levels without too much difficulty. As it levels, it learns Curse: Duskull is arguably the games best Ghost-type user of Curse, but its drawbacks do make it tough to use. Thanks to its abysmal speed, it is a good choice for the Macho Brace during its training arc to compensate for lost EVs thanks to coming so late. Defeating weak Aqua and Magma grunts should put Duskull in the position to evolve at Lv. 37 without too much difficulty. 

Dusclops is able to start accomplishing most of what Duskull does, better. 40 more points in each defense plus 20 more HP means that Dusclops is significantly more tanky. 70 Attack is just enough to deal meaningful damage with its STAB moves: local signature move Shadow Punch is a decent option that can help later on in a pinch against evasion-users like Juan's Kingdra, though using the Shadow Ball TM here is arguably better if the player hasn't yet. It also learns Focus Punch and Earthquake by TM if those moves are desirable - on top of aforementioned Ice and Psychic moves, this means Dusclops has pretty solid coverage if used strictly as a bulky attacker. The Shell Bell is a really good choice for Dusclops, since its high defenses / low HP combo mean that it will take damage well and be able to heal a larger percentage of it back for each attack. It also gets access to common tools like Rest, Toxic, and Protect that let it tank better than most: on top of Will-O-Wisp and Bind, Dusclops has tons of options for its stall strategy that make it fun to use. Worth noting is that Dusclops loses Levitate in favor of Pressure - a tradeoff that comes out to a wash, I think. Pressure is incredibly good for stalling bosses who use Full Restores and moves like Recover and Rest; the relatively frail Absol being the only alternative means that Dusclops does Pressure stalling better than anyone.

Dusclops will also fair decently well against the bosses going forward, for the most part. Tate & Liza have a hard time taking Dusclops down as it slings Shadow Punches/Balls (bonus points awarded if it uses Skill Swap to get Levitate back during this fight!), and while it doesn't have a strict type advantage, it does well as a wall against many of Wallace/Juan's weaker team members. A hilarious mention goes out to Dusclops for having exactly the right coverage moveset in Ghost/Fighting/Ice/Psychic to be able to hit every one of Wally's team members super effectively. Anyways, it doesn't have a great time against Sidney, who is the easiest Elite Four member anyways, while it has a competitive relationship with Phoebe's team. From experience, it will do pretty well here at slinging out damage and staying alive even if it can't hold out the entire fight. As a special wall it will again be pretty effective against Glacia and even Drake and either Champion to some extent, being a safe switch in that can dish out status at the very least.

Frankly, Pokemon games never really require that a bulky offense/utility-oriented Pokemon is used: speed and attack stats are key. Even by the challenge ruleset I established for this series, sweepers are going to make playthroughs easier. Yet if this role is desired after all, if the player is willing to spend a few more turns in fights in exchange for a reliable Pokemon that does a great job at neutralizing huge threats, then Dusclops is a great example of this. The Ghost type and Pressure ability, and high Def/SpD statline are not in high supply in Hoenn, so it is able to stand out as a unique unit that pays off pretty well.
