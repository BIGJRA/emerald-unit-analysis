### Analysis

**Verdict: An unfortunately underwhelming version exclusive that probably only appeals to fans of its design**.

Compared to its version exclusive counterpart Zangoose, Seviper is fairly underwhelming as a unit. The earlier available Gulpin evolves around the time you get Seviper and can fill a more defensive role than Seviper. Similarly, using Zubat will lead to an evolution into Crobat around this time, who is arguably a better physical option. In a region with a very low amount of Grass types, there simply isn't much for Poison STAB to accomplish, so Seviper doesn't really have a chance to stand out much and doesn't have a single major fight where it's STAB is particularly effective. Still, its ability to function as a mixed attacker / support Pokemon due to its reasonably wide movepool and decent attacking stats make it able to contribute if a player is inclined to use it, and it doesn't have many fights where it stands no chance of contributing (other than maybe Tate & Liza).

Seviper is able to start contributing as soon as its obtained due to high stats, but isn't a powerhouse right away. It gets its signature move, Poison Tail, right away... but it might be one of the worst signature moves in the series. With 50 Base Power, it has the potential to poison and a higher critical hit rate. The only other offensive Poison type moves it gets are the sidegrade Poison Fang at Lv. 34, Sludge Bomb via TM around the same time. Using Seviper's STAB meaningfully requires this TM, so Poison Fang goes to the wayside. In my opinion, making Seviper a more interesting unit probably should start here - switching Poison Fang and Poison Tail around in the learnset and making Poison Tail a better signature move would work wonders! At least, a high critical hit rate combined with Sludge Bomb's base power would help it stand out a bit and give Seviper an interesting quality. 

Of the Pokemon in Hoenn, Seviper is the only one to get (the unfortunately inaccurate) Glare at Lv. 25, which is cool but still outclassed by Dustox + Stun Spore. It even gets the fun but not remarkable interaction of countering Synchronize thanks to its Shed Skin ability, which is also found only on Seviper in Hoenn (aside from Silcoon and Cascoon), so if the player wants to try having fun with... maybe shaking off status conditions each turn... then Seviper does have at least some unique flair.

Other notable options during this time include the expensive TM Flamethrower, TM Dig, and Crunch for coverage. This wide moveset is able to help it contribute in fights like Flannery and Norman though it is not really a standout. Giga Drain is an option that allows it to work like a worse Vileplume, but still able to contribute against the late game Water fights like Archie, Juan, and Wallace. Towards the late game, Swagger and Haze are status options if it is falling off offensively, though not particularly great against the late game trainers. One can save TMs and Tutors like Rest, Toxic, Sleep Talk, and Taunt if they want to run that set, though its defensive stats don't make it particularly suited for this role compared to peers. It also gets Earthquake and Iron Tail, though it isn't the best user of them, it can still help in fights like Glacia and Steven (S) if needed, but again can't really be the star.

With a couple potential sets, Seviper feels like a jack-of-some-trades, master-of-none, is outclassed, and doesn't really have a short or long term niche. While it is a cool design in my opinion, unfortunately this unit does not feel great to use in Gen. III.
