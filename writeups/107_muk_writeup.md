### Analysis

**TL;DR: As Weezing "just makes sense" in Hoenn, Muk "is kinda just there" but is still a fine unit.**

In the Koffing analysis, I went over all of what what makes the Koffing line an interesting and well utilized addition to the Hoenn region: its new gamechanging ability, its thematic place in the teams of Ninja Boys, and its new role in Hoenn's biology contrasted to Kanto's make the line interesting. Yet Ruby version made Koffing available only as a soft-version exclusive with Sapphire's Grimer, both available in each but at different rarities and slightly different starting levels. Grimer, as contrasted with Koffing, is just **there**. Going back through the points that make Koffing fit in Hoenn: there is exactly 0 Grimer and 1 Muk in enemy trainer teams in this game, so it doesn't standout in Hoenn's world-building much. Levitate its abilities are not: Stench is a useful-for-playthrough signature ability with no battle effect that repels wild Pokemon at least, while Sticky Hold, shared with Gulpin, allows it to keep its hold item against the 11 trainers in the game with Thief and Knock Off... Would the Hoenn Pokedex would have been just fine if Grimer was removed in favor of only Koffing in all three games?

The strongest case (beyond padding out version exclusive lists) for including Grimer is its new availability. Gen I makes it available just before the seventh badge while Gen II pushes it to the Kanto postgame only. Generation III finally let you get it before four badges, so players can bond with it for longer. It still needs to fight for its team-slot amongst a sea of now-available Poison types including Koffing in the same dungeon (though potentially rarer in Sapphire), the new Gulpin line available slightly before, the common-to-Sapphire Seviper soon after, and dual types like Tentacool, Oddish, Roselia, and Zubat all in play. Yet using a Grimer is still somewhat of a different experience from using its Poison-type brethren, so let's get into it.

Grimer has decent bulk for a first-stage in 80/50/50, useful for when Grimer goes second thanks to its 25 Speed. Unlike Koffing, Grimer leans more on its physical attack, meaning Sludge, Dig, or perhaps Rock Tomb are its strongest damage options and giving it a chance to contribute against Flannery in the midgame. Grimer starts with a good deal of support moves too: the inaccurate Disable and Poison Gas can be used while it uses Minimize and later Acid Armor to set up defensively. Screech helps it secure kills on bulkier Pokemon or more likely weaken bosses for teammates to take down. It plays differently than the other Poison types during the Grimer phase at least. A few more tools will open up to Grimer going forward: Toxic, Thunderbolt and most importantly early Sludge Bomb among them. Grimer is probably too weak to be a key player against Norman and Winona, showing that its finely-tuned evolution level worked for it in Gen I while it holds it back in Gen III. 

Once Grimer evolves, it doubles down on its good traits statwise and notably gains a ton of SpD. With Acid Armor Muk is able to cover itself defensively extremely well, which works with common TMs like Protect, Toxic, and Rest to allow it to be a dependable tank. This game doesn't have too many Psychic or Ground type opponents in the endgame, so Muk fulfills this role fairly well. Offensively, it can hit hard with a few physical types in Poison and Fighting or attempt special coverage through Electric, and Fire moves at least. As a Poison type it struggles against Tate & Liza and Phoebe to some extent though it has decent neutral matchups against Juan, Sidney, Glacia, some of Drake, and Wallace. Muk in the endgame is reasonably strong, but not dominating or centralizing. It's a solid Pokemon in this game with some new context and tools to use, yet not wholly fitting as compared to its Pokemon Mansion/Fiery Path brother Koffing.
