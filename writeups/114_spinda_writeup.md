### Analysis

**TL;DR: Spinda is sorta fun for being designed around confusion, but is so weak that it feels awful regardless.**

Spinda is a particularly strange unit. On one hand, it has a very clear design plus gimmick that give it a clear purpose in Hoenn's cast of new Pokemon. On the other, Spinda is stuck in single-stage Pokemon with flat-60-stats purgatory, preventing it from being able to contribute significantly even with its gimmick. Let's look into what this gimmick is and what it provides in RSE.

Spinda is all about confusion: Psybeam, Dizzy Punch, and Teeter Dance are all available in its level-up movepool and can cause this status effect. In fact, Teeter Dance and Dizzy Punch are both exclusive to Spinda in Hoenn (excluding Kanto mons and egg moves), exemplifying this trait. Teeter Dance in particular hits all Pokemon in Doubles, of which there aren't too many in Hoenn but is fun to exploit with a Persim Berry nonetheless. Its only ability here is Own Tempo, which makes it immune to confusion itself; its ability won't contribute significantly in a playthrough, but at least adds to its theme. Across the rest of its moveset there is some support synergy with Confusion: the inaccurate Hypnosis and rarely useful Psych Up available by level up, while common options like Attract, Protect, Toxic, Substitute are TM/Tutor only. Reliable Confusion (with good luck) can allow a teammate to sweep, so this role is not entirely useless at least.

Offensively has a bit of coverage though nothing too strong: at best it can use a combo of Focus Punch, Psychic/Psybeam, Shadow Ball/Faint Attack, and Return/Dizzy Punch/Double-Edge/Flail, I suppose. Thrash in Generation III is in its "weaker than max power Return" era and here is a Lv. 56 move, so its synergy with Own Tempo does not get to shine in these games. Although it is the weakest user of the move without much SpA and SpD to begin with, Spinda gets Calm Mind to allow it to sweep... maybe. Still, all these offensive options end up moot as 60 Atk and SpA do not amount to significant damage and 60 in all defenses mean it will not survive long in the endgame.

With all that said though, Spinda doesn't have any significant fights in Hoenn where it shines, as something like Sableye does. Especially in Emerald with the Swagger tutor, Spinda's confusion spreading isn't wholly unique or useful. Teeter Dance is fun in Doubles, yet there aren't too many Doubles fights. To compare Spinda with Castform, Castform has 70 in every stat instead of 60 and has a much better gimmick in its form/type changes, Weather Ball, and vast movepool. Spinda doesn't need to be a top tier threat or anything, but its extremely low stats make me question what the point is of making Spinda so utterly terrible! If one Hoenn Pokemon _seems like_ it should evolve during this generation, I think Spinda takes the cake for sure. Instead, it has "Luvdisc-value" in being so bad that a certain type of player will be attracted to it at least?
