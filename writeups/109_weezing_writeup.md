### Analysis

**Verdict: Lost in a sea of Poison types in its original generation, Weezing is completely reinvented in Hoenn!**

The Koffing line was fairly straightforward in Kanto: among tons of Poison types, it was the one that could use Explosion and had a high defense stat. Along with other Poison types it was a favorite of the "Biker" trainer class and was only available in an abandoned science laboratory, fitting into the themes of industrialization and technology vs. nature that Gen I rests upon. Koffing was available late in Gen I - games where the player can have a Nidoking or Nidoqueen up and running far earlier. There are only 67 slots in the Hoenn Dex granted to Kanto and Johto Pokemon, yet there is a case to be made none of them are quite as well-integrated into Hoenn as the Koffing line! It is available earlier in the game, doesn't have quite as many powerful Poison type rivals early in the game, is given a new context in the game's world... oh, and it has a certain game-changing ability. Gen III Koffing is completely different than it was before - if every returning unit was carefully considered like Koffing was, this game would have even more series-changing gameplay!

Let's go over the major differences of Koffing in RSE. For one, Koffing tends to appear on the teams of the "Ninja Boy" trainer class, who frequently hides in ash piles and fake-tree standups. It is available in the wild only within the Fiery Path, a distinctly natural area as compared to the Pokemon Mansion. Instead of being a Pokemon byproduct of pollution, here it is found naturally and being used as a smoke bomb by trainers notably in tune with nature! On the gameplay side, a player familiar with the mon from previous games might try using Ground moves on it - surprise! The new Levitate ability is here to give Koffing the unique trait of cancelling one of its two weaknesses!

Without a Grass gym it never has the express advantage against major boss fights, though is still a good contributor that will feel better than it does in Gen I or II. One advantage it has is that its sole weakness, Psychic, isn't that common in these games. Poison types from Generation I generally have the Normal type trait of having a strangely wide movepool - Koffing gets to keep this trait here. With similar decent Atk and SpA it is able to utilize said movepool well - Sludge, Rollout, Thief, Shock Wave, and Selfdestruct are all options early on that later can give way to Thunder, Fire Blast, Sludge Bomb, Shadow Ball, and Explosion. Smokescreen, Poison Gas/Toxic, and even Haze and Destiny Bond are all good support options. It won't be a sweeper or the star of the show, but spending the time to evolve Koffing pays off with a solid and unique Pokemon that is more fun to use in Hoenn than Kanto or Johto!
