### Analysis

**Verdict: Alakazam is redundant in Hoenn thanks to Gardevoir, but it's a familiar, easy-to-use unit with good payoff nonetheless.**

After being basically one of the most busted units in all of Gen I and II, the Alakazam line is back in Hoenn, again being one of the most powerful team choices in the game. The story of using one consists of pushing through having only Teleport as an Abra to evolution at Lv. 16, then basically steamrolling the game from there with Kadabra, even more so if the player chooses to just trade it right away into Alakazam. The story of starting with a weak Psychic type Pokemon without attacking moves obtainable early in the game with Synchronize as an ability that will evolve two more times sounds familiar in Hoenn though... the Ralts line already does exactly this! Gardevoir will end up with more bulk and a bit more coverage while Alakazam is more min-maxed towards fast damage, but for a game that only put 65 of the original 251 Pokemon into Hoenn, including Abra when Ralts does nearly the same things for a playthrough is a bit of a strange choice. Ruby and Sapphire don't allow the player any non-Hoenn Pokemon until defeating the first badge, but Emerald allows the player an Abra early, breaking this rule for some reason. Alakazam is a strange-feeling choice for the Hoenn Pokedex.

Putting aside its unnecessary inclusion in RSE, Abra is still obtainable in Hoenn, so let's talk about it in gameplay. There is no reason to get one before Roxanne since it won't be able to do anything (again, why did Emerald push it up here?), so the player might as well get one at its highest level in Granite Cave. The classic struggle with Abra is getting one thanks to Teleport ending the battle after one ball throw, which is still a problem here. A Great Ball will have a 40.5% chance of getting a Lv. 10 Abra, so even with some potential save/resetting, it's a waiting game. Next is actually getting it levels - the player is able to backtrack for the Exp. Share if they like or jump ahead to Slateport to grab TM Thief - Abra is the best user of it in the game since it means it can use its massive 105 SpA against early game enemies to get to Lv. 16 quickly. One or both of these methods make getting Abra to evolve fairly painless!

If the player was very proactive and saved the Route 109 trainers for Abra with Thief, they can probably evolve it before fighting Brawly. Kadabra with Confusion will completely destroy him... and if the player is willing to trade, they can break the game by getting 490 BST Alakazam by this point. While a cute idea for the games back in the '90s, the impact of trade evolutions on the single player RPG gameplay is not well-thought-out. Some players won't be interested in trading (which leaves some Pokemon like Graveler in the dust) and some will be interested in trading (leading to the problem with Alakazam), but here I will assume that trading is on the table. For Kadabra, not evolving simply means it will have slightly worse stats and needs to use the TM to learn Calm Mind, so no huge losses. 

Alakazam's moveset is a pretty weird one. On one hand, the design was strongly inspired by magic back in Gen I, and its moveset largely reflects this. It's thematically fitting level up moves like Disable, Reflect, Role Play (by not evolving Kadabra), Recover, and Trick might imply that a unique support set is worth doing with Alakazam. But, thanks to its low Def and HP, it really prefers to just get the ball rolling on sweeping: these moves are somewhat wasted on Alakazam. Why worry about all that when it just gets Calm Mind, Psybeam then Psychic at reasonable levels? Thief, Shock Wave, and Hidden Power are its only special coverage moves, but that really doesn't hold back Alakazam too much - by the time it has Psychic and Calm Mind, only Dark types will really be able to stall it. Worth mentioning is Synchronize, a fun utility ability that can pair with a held berry to make for some funny moments against status move spammers. Inner Focus is far less good here thanks to Alakazam's massive speed. Altogether, it is such a confused design for a Pokemon - if anything, Hoenn should've added a different Psychic type line with different stats that could make more use of the status moves - Mr. Mime would be more interesting of a unit in this game, I think.

It isn't going to be able to just sweep every boss fight in the game or anything, but it's just so good at what it needs to that some basic team support in... a starter? maybe one more guy? will be just fine in conquering the fights it doesn't easily take. The two Elite Four members that it has type disadvantages against are the first and easiest two, so its not like players investing too much into their Alakazam will hit a wall in the end game or anything. With some four of Reflect, Calm Mind, Recover, Psychic, and Shock Wave, it can basically sweep Wallace as long as it doesn't get paralyzed, so there's that. Steven gives it a bit more of a challenge since Metagross actually walls Alakazam, but even then enough Calm Minds plus Shock Wave might work. Alakazam is just good for its straight forward sweeping potential in Hoenn, but also in basically every other game it is in.

Gardevoir is more fun to use in Hoenn, I think - it is much more unique identity in Hoenn, the idea of using Wally's ace in the players team is more fun, etc. Alakazam's moveset has novelty that doesn't match its stats and ends up being a sweeper that can do one thing really well, but at least it is super reliable at doing that. This is speculation of course, but I think the best explanation is that Alakazam was included in Hoenn to give players an out if they were feeling overwhelmed by all the new Pokemon: being one of the first old Pokemon available in Ruby and Sapphire and being pushed up in Emerald would support that. Could be that GameFreak was a bit worried about players that might feel stuck with the new Pokemon and so they put in... basically one of the best ones for those players to recognize and latch on to. Even if I think the redundancy is unneeded here, it is good that players who just want to rely on old favorites have the opportunity to do so.
